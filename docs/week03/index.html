  <h2>The Functor Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    Functor is probably a word you haven't run into before. In the functional programming world it is used a lot 
    so it would be a good idea to start understanding and using it. Now, you could go out and do a lot of googling 
    to try and come up with some definitions of what a functor is with relation to computer science in general and 
    functional programming specifically. Instead of doing so, how about we provided a few definitions used in this 
    course along with the bodies of knowledge the definitions come from. When you feel you're ready to tackle these, go ahead 
    and read them. &#128578
  </p>
<ul>
    <li><dfn>Homomorphism</dfn>: a transformation of one set, group, category, etc. into another that preserves in the second the relations between elements of the first.</li>

    <li><dfn>Functor</dfn>: the transformation from set to set, group to group, category to category, etc. that 
    preserves the relations between the elements of the first set \(F::A\rightarrow B\)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Alright. So that was tough and probably left you in a little bit of a brain fog. How about splitting them 
  up and taking them one at a time to see if more light can be shed on each of them and the relationships between 
  them? In doing so, let's try to provide you with a high-level understanding of what each of these things are 
  while staying true to their meaning.
</p>
<h3>Homomorphism (Mathematics)</h3>

<p>
Homomorphism comes from the Greek <span style="font-style: italic">homoios morphe</span> meaning 'similar form.' So if two sets, groups, trees, or some other type of category of things are homomorphic, then when trying to solve a 
vexing problem in a specific set, you can convert the problem and set into another set where the problem is easier 
to solve, solve the problem there, and then convert the solution back to the original set. Then the problem is 
solved. In problem solving space, this approach is called 
<span style="font-style: italic">transform and conquer</span>. 
</p>
<p>
  Here is an example from the area of the testing of medications. Imagine you have a medication that might cure a 
  specific, common form of cancer. It also might be deadly. How can the medication be tested? One traditional 
  approach is to view mice, rats, and other mammals as homomorphs of humans. Give the drug to these in randomized 
  trials and you can tell if the drug is poisonous to mammals. Unlike Mathematics and Computer Science, this 
  approach doesn't guarantee the drug isn't poisonous to humans, these animals not being exact homomorphs for 
  humans, but it does greatly reduce the probability that the drug would kill people.
</p>
<h3>Functor (Mathematics)</h3>
<p>
  The word functor comes from the word function. It was adopted in the 1930's by mathematicians who study 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory">Category Theory</a> to express the idea of a 
  function that is a mapping of one category to another.
</p>
<p>
  Consider this situation. Alice is a Chemistry major. Or another way to say this is she is in the Chemistry 
  major category. Alice goes to a party designed to help people from different colleges interact and get to know 
  each other. If she meets another Chemistry major, her interactions with that person will probably be 
  the same as they have always been with other Chemistry majors.
</p>
<p>
  However, at the party Alice meets an Art major named Stan. Even though Alice has not changed, she is after all 
  still herself, she will have to interact with Stan in a different way. She will attempt to modify the ways she 
  interacts with other Chemistry majors in order to interact with Stan. When she does this, she is applying 
  an AtParty functor. 
</p>

<h3>Functor (Functional Programming)</h3>
<p>
  The definition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor_(functional_programming)">Functor in Functional 
  Programming</a> and other types of computer languages is inspired by Category Theory. There are subtle 
  differences between the two, but that is beyond the scope of this class. If you are interested in a mathematical 
  take on functional programming functors, there is a short succinct statement on 
  <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/127510/functional-programming-and-category-theory">stackExchange</a> 
  along with another <a href="http://math.andrej.com/2016/08/06/hask-is-not-a-category/">math heavy, detailed 
  explanation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the takeaway from this controversy. Just because you understand what a functor is in functional 
  programming, don't go thinking you know what a functor in Category Theory is. You don't. If you want to know 
  that, go study Category Theory. It will open your mind to a very different way of thinking.
</p>
<p>
  In this course we will use the re-imagined definition of Functor. For this definition, 
  there are two laws that must be true in order for something to be a functor. The first is called the identity 
  law. Essentially it means that the functor does not use or produce any side effects. The second is the 
  composition law, \(f(g\circ h) = f(g)\circ f(h)\). To be a functor, when the functor applies to the composition 
  of one or more functions the result must be the same as the functor being applied to each function separately. At 
  this point in time, just be aware of these laws. You will see them described more formally at the end of the 
  reading for week 04.
</p>
<h4>Map</h4>
<p>
  An application of our functor definition you are familiar with is the map BIF (Built In Function). Here, a list 
  and a function to be used to modify each element of the list are passed as parameters. The value of the map 
  functor is a new list containing modified versions of each element of the original list as you see in the first 
  line of Figure 1.
</p>
</p>
  <aside class="left_wide">
    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The declaration and definition <br>of the map functor.</figcaption>
  <figure>
    $$\begin{align*}
  map &:: [a]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow b)\rightarrow[b]\\
  map &:: [a]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow b)\rightarrow [\text{ }]\\&\text{ }when\text{ }[a]\text{ is empty };\\
  map &:: [h\mid t]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow b)\rightarrow\\
  &[h]:[map\text{ }t\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow b)]\\&\text{ }when\text{ }[a]\text{ is empty }.
  \end{align*}
  $$ 
  </figure>
  </aside>
<p>
  When you used the map BIF before you probably used it to add, subtract, multiply, or divide some list of numbers 
  or something similar to that. You saw above that functors are applied to functions. There seems to be a 
  conflict between the way you've used map and the definition but there isn't. All you need to remember is 
  variables can be viewed as being functions that always return the same result. After all, for $f(x)=1$, $1=f(n)$.
</p>
<p>
  Being applied in a Functional Programming space, the map functor is defined recursively. If the list-type 
  parameter of map is empty, the value of the map functor is an empty list (the first function clause in Figure 1). If the list-type parameter is 
  non-empty, the head of the list is passed to the lambda-type parameter. The value of the lambda with the head as 
  its parameter is then prepended to a recursive call to map itself with the tail of the list-type parameter 
  passed instead of the complete list (the second function clause of Figure 1).
</p>
<p>
  Thus, each element of the original list is converted to a new element, possibly even a new type, and then 
  added to a distinct list that is created as the value of the call to the map functor.
</p>
<h4>Filter</h4>
<p>
  The filter BIF is significantly different. Instead of a 1-to-1 correspondence between the 
  list passed as a parameter and the list that is the value of filter, the value list can, but does 
  not have to, have fewer elements. The value list contains only those elements of the original list that 
  cause the lambda parameter to return \(true\). 
</p>
</p>
  <aside class="right_wide">
    <figcaption>Fig.1 - The declaration and definition <br>of the filter functor.</figcaption>
  <figure>
    $$\begin{align*}
  filter &:: [a]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow Boolean)\rightarrow[b]\\
  filter &:: [a]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow Boolean)\rightarrow [\text{ }]\\&\text{ }when\text{ }[a]\text{ is empty };\\
  filter &:: [h\mid t]\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow Boolean)\rightarrow\\
  &[h]:filter\text{ }t\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow Boolean)\\
  &when\text{ }\lambda\text{ }a = true\\
  &filter\text{ }t\text{ }(\lambda :: a\rightarrow Boolean)\\
  &when\text{ }\lambda\text{ }a = false.
  \end{align*}
  $$ 
  </figure>
  </aside>
<p>
<p>
  The filter functor is defined recursively. If the list-type 
  parameter of map is empty, the value of the map functor is an empty list (the first clause of the function in Figure 2).
  If the list-type parameter is non-empty (the second clause of the function in Figure 2), the head of the list is passed 
  to the lambda-type parameter, and if the value of the lambda is then true, the head is prepended to a recursive 
  call to filter itself with the tail of the list-type parameter passed instead of the complete list .
</p>
<p>
  Thus, each element of the original list that matches the logic specified in the lambda is 
  added to a distinct list that is created as the value of the call to the filter functor.
