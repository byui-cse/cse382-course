<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
<h3>Task 1</h3>
<p>
    Write and test a custom implementation of the map functor called c_map (see Figure 2 for the description).
</p>
<h3>Task 2</h3>
<p>
    Apply c_map to encipher and decipher a piece of text containing only capital letters and spaces using a 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar cipher</a>.
</p>
<h3>Task 3</h3>
<p>
    Use the map BIF to map a large list. Compare the speed and the accuracy of the two implementations. (HINT: Google how to time code snippets in the language you are using. Also make sure your run your speed test several times.)
</p>
<h3>Task 4</h3>
<p>
    Write and test a custom implementation of the filter functor called c_filter (see Figure 3 for the description). 
</p>
<h3>Task 5</h3>
<p>
    Apply c_filter as a sieve to find all of the prime numbers from 2 to 20,000. (HINT: You may need to write a 
    helper function that performs the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/">Sieve of 
    Eratosthenes</a> or some other sieve of your choice.)
</p>
<h3>Task 6</h3>
<p>
    Use the filter BIF to sieve to find all of the prime numbers from 2 through 20,000. Compare the speed and the accuracy of the two implementations.
</p>

<h3>Task 7</h3>
<p>
    After completing Tasks 1 through 6, find the source code for 
    the BIFs for your chosen language and compare them to your implementations of the c_map and c_filter functors. Speculate, 
    in writing, as to why the standard implementations differ, or not, from yours.
</p>
<section>
    <p>
        AFTER you have completed and debugged your code, <a href="provided_solutions.zip" class="steps_image" alt="one of many possible code solutions">take a look at one of many possible solutions</a> and compare it to the code you wrote.
