	<h1>Your Tasks</h1>
    <p>You have three tasks this week.</p>
    <h2>Task 1: Make and Join a Team</h2>

<p>
Your first task is to join a team and inform the teacher who is on your team. Teams sizes should be 5 or 6. Only one member of the team needs to inform the teacher who is on their team. Do this BEFORE the last day of class for the week.
</p>
<p>To be able to wisely form a team, it is important for you to get to know your classmates and find a few you wish to collaborate with during the semester. Use the discussion tool your instructor has chosen, tell others about yourself. Include the same kinds of information you would want to know about them so all of you can make an informed decision about who to team-up with. Mention your strengths and weaknesses (ex. programming, using unfamiliar technology, researching answers, abstract thinking).
</p>
<p>
Your initial post should be a few paragraphs long. Include in your posting a list of when you are available outside of class (possible meeting times of day and days of the week).
</p>
<p>
Use these postings and the discussion tool to arrange and join a team. Remember to inform your teacher who is on your team.
</p>

<p>
You and your team members will be accountable to each other for the learning activities you do outside of class.
This accounting and peer-assessment will happen regularly. Expect to spend about 6 hours outside of class each week doing readings, writing code, and completing other tasks. You will need this amount of time-on-task to be able to make a good accounting to and support your teammates.
</p>
<p>
    Each week, one person is selected by the group to serve the others. They do this by being responsible to see that the work is done with a minimum of interruptions and problems during the week. This is not a managerial role. The person is responsible to do just as much work regarding completing the tasks as every other week. They just have additional responsibilities. This weekly responsibility is to be evenly distributed across everyone on the team. During the first week, assign this servic responsibility to team members for all of the weeks of the semester.
</p>
<h2>Task 2: </h2>
Use the supplied learning assistant to complete a review of Erlang. Meet with your team outside of class to explore your and their understandings and misconceptions.
<h2>Task 3: </h2>
<p>
    Read <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank">Elder Oak's general conference talk</a> in it&rsquo;s entirety. Read the portion of Barney and Maughan&rsquo;s philosophy article relative to Complexity Theory (both links are found in the reading). Take notes on both. Compare and contrast the cold syntax and phrasing of the latter with the warmth of the former. Such is the difference between philosophy and the gospel of Jesus Christ.
</p>
<p>
    You can find the links to these two items in the reading for this week.
</p>

<h2>Task 4: </h2>
<p>
    Meet outside of class with your team to discuss and compare notes on the readings. Strive for a deap, rich discussion.
