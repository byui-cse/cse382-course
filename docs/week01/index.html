<h2>The Why of Patterns and Data Structures</h2>
<p>
Welcome! You are about to embark on a learning adventure that will change 
the way you design and write code. The generations of programmers that 
came before you have exprimented, learned, grown, and shared what they've 
learned with each other and you. In this class, you step out of being limited 
by a single language and start to explore what is already known about 
language-free functional programming.  
</p>
<p>
  This class is just the beginning of your learning adventure. All through your 
  career you will experiment, learn, grow, and share what you have learned. 
  This is part of being a professional that cares about their craft. Part of this 
  adventure that lies in your path is exploring the vast set of 
  writings on patterns and data structures, both professional and academic.
</p>
<p>
  As your understanding of the patterns and data structures discovered by those 
  who came before you increases and improves, your professionalism and skill 
  will also increase and improve. Gone will be time wasted rediscovering 
  something already in this body of knowledge contributed by others. 
  Eventually, you too will contribute to that body of knowledge as you share 
  new patterns and data structures you discover as you solve significant problems for 
  companies for whom you work.

  <h4>Some Definitions</h4>
  
<p>
  <dfn>Pattern</dfn>: a particular way in which something usually happens or is done
</p>
  <dfn>Data Structure</dfn>:  a defined pattern for efficiently storing, accessing, and processing data
<p>

Are you ready for the ride? Then strap on your seat belt, and let&rsquo;s begin! Take
notes on your impressions regarding what you are about to read. You will need these
notes when you meet with your team on Friday of this week.

<h2>Patterns and Data Structures and Algorithms...Oh My!</h2>
<p>
  These big three parts of programming, regardless of the language you choose, are related. An 
  Algorithm is a pattern consisting of a series of steps that is known to accomplish a 
  specific task with a known efficiency. A Data Structure is a pattern that lays out how to 
  store, retrieve, and manipulate data with a known efficiency. 
  This connection between patterns, data structures, and algorithms means that we can, and will, 
  use the more abstract word pattern to describe both of the other two types, reserving the 
  more detailed words, algorithm and data structure, when they illuminate the topic.
</p>
<p>
  As time goes by, you will realize that algorithms and data structures interact as well. 
  Useful algorithms use or produce one or more data structures, and data structures use one or more 
  algorithms. Such is the complexity and recursiveness of life. 
  Nothing is actually independent of everything else. Instead, everything is dependent, directly or 
  indirectly, on everything else. The lives of mothers and fathers change the lives of their children 
  and the lives of the children change the lives of their mothers and fathers. Families, of all kinds, 
  are complex systems.

<blockquote>
<p>
 All complex systems continually and recursively modify themselves... One part of any recursive routine is the 
 routine  itself. Or in terms of complex systems, part of a complex system's existence is to bring itself into 
 existence anew - to continuously emerge - or as expressed by Kampis, to evolve. This evolution results in 
 the increasing complexity of complex systems.(<a href="https://journals.library.ualberta.ca/complicity/index.php/complicity/article/view/24198/19190" target="_blank">Barney and Maughan</a>)

<p>
  Let&rsquo;s get out of cold philosophy and into the realm of the gospel where greater warmth, truth, and light 
  lies. Elder Oaks taught in 
  a conference talk about how The gospel of Jesus Christ challenges us to become.
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    The Final Judgment is not just an evaluation of a sum total of good and evil acts - what we have done. It is an acknowledgment of the final effect of our acts and thoughts - what we have become. It is not enough for anyone just to go through the motions. The commandments, ordinances, and covenants of the gospel are not a list of deposits required to be made in some heavenly account. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a plan that shows us how to become what our Heavenly Father desires us to become. (<a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2000/10/the-challenge-to-become?lang=eng" target="_blank">Dallin H. Oaks</a>)
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us that the only thing that can change us is us. As we become what we can, 
  should, and need to become, our becoming opens up the ability to become even more. Light begets light until 
  we are filled with light. Or, if we turn from Christ, darkness begets further darkness until we loose all that we 
  once had. Each of us is complex and part of a greater complexity that is our family, friends, aquaintances, 
  those we don't know, nature, space, galaxies, and universes.
</p>

<p>
  Exploring the complexity that is algorithms, data structures, and patterns is the journey we now begin.
