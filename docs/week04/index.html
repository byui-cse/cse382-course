<h2>Beyond Map and Filter</h2>
<p>
    The functors map and filter are great. Use them whenever you can and they are the best 
    choice for that situation. They do not cover all situations. Thats why there are other 
    basic functors that are part of every functional programmer's tool set. These are 
    reduce, formally known as fold left and fold right, and unfold. It's these two 
    that really flesh out our tool set. 
</p>
<h3>Fold Left and Fold Right</h3>
<p>
    The basic concept of folding is that you start with something large and reduce its exposed 
    surface area. This is true not only for clothes, paper, and and other such things, 
    but for data as well. If your code snippet, function, or application accepts a bunch of 
    data and then produces, as output, fewer computed results than the amount of data it 
    started with, the code was a for of fold. Maybe your app took in a bunch of historical data 
    about the weather and produced a prediction for the next few days. That's a fold. 
</p>
</p>
  <aside class="left">
    
  <figure>
    <dfn>Fold</dfn> - a function type where the input count is greater than the output count.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 1</figcaption>
  </aside>
<p>
<p>
    Maybe your app accessed a database of customers and produced an ordered list of customers 
    your sales people should contact with specific needs rather than a complete list. That's a 
    fold.
</p>
<p>
    Or maybe you use an application to help you track and fix bugs in your code. It accesses the 
    entire database of defects and selects just the ones that match details you provide it. That's 
    another fold app.
</p>

<p>
    When you stop and think about it, the number of applications, functions, and code snippets 
    that perform a fold-type operation is huge...and thankfully so. Imagine if the data 
    produced by any of the apps mentioned was as large as the input data. They would be nearly 
    useless.&#128556;
</p>
<p>
    Fold behavior comes in two flavors, fold left, from left to right, and fold right, from right 
    to left. There will be times when selecting between right and left types of folds is important. 
    There will be other times when it is not.

<h4>foldl</h4>
<p>

<p>
    Let's start with the foldl function. Take a look at Figure 2. There you will see foldl's declaration states 
    that the functor's set of parameters is a list, an accumulator, and a lambda function and the value of foldl 
    is a single value. It is important to understand that the accumulator can be of any type but that  the type 
    of the lambda's parameter 'a' must match the type of the accumulator for the functor. Also, if the accumulator 
    is numeric, its initial value could be 0 if you are wanting to do something similar to addition, or its initial 
    value could be 1 if you are wanting to do something like multiplication.
</p>
<p>

  <aside class="right">
    <figcaption>Definition 1 - <dfn>Anti-pattern</dfn>:</figcaption>
  <figure>
     a common response to a common problem that has a high probability of being 
    ineffective or counterproductive.
  </figure>
  </aside>
</p>
<p>
    There are other things your lambda function could be doing with the list. If it is concatenating the list, the 
    accum parameter could be an empty string. If, however, you are thinking of passing in an empty list as the 
    accumulator, you should think again. That would be an anti-pattern. You would be better served by using a 
    combination of map and filter functors in this situation rather than a fold functor. 
</p>
<p>
    Notice in the second clause of foldl a local variable called temp is created and is assigned the value of the 
    lambda when the lambda is passed the accumulator and the head of the list. In the last phrase of the second 
    clause this temporary variable is passed as the accumulator value to recursive call in the second phrase of 
    this same clause of foldl.
</p>

<p>
    While organizing your code like it is in Figure 2 may seem to make sense, it should be avoided. Figure 2 is 
    included in this reading as an example of a common anti-pattern. Anti-patterns are patterns that seem good but have hidden badness. Don't use them. Instead, the temp variable should be discarded and the call to lambda 
    should be placed in the last phrase of the clause as you see in Figure 3.
</p>

<h4>foldr</h4>
</p>
  <aside class="right_wide">
    <figcaption>Fig. 4 - The declaration and definition <br>of the foldr functor.</figcaption>
  <figure>
   $$\begin{align*}
  foldr &:: [a]\text{ } accum \text{ }(\lambda :: \text{ }a\text{ } b\rightarrow c)\rightarrow c\\
  foldr &:: [a]\text{ } accum \text{ }\text{ }(\lambda ::\text{ }a\text{ }b\rightarrow c)\rightarrow accum\\&\text{ }when\text{ }[a]\text{ is empty };\\
  foldr &:: [h\mid t]\text{ } accum \text{ }\text{ }(\lambda ::\text{ }a\text{ }b\rightarrow c)\rightarrow\\
  &foldr\text{ }::\text{ }h\text{ }\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ } accum\text{ }t)\text{ }(\lambda ::\text{ }a\text{ }b\rightarrow c).
  \end{align*}
  $$ 
  </figure>
  </aside>
<p>

<p>
    Foldr is much like foldl. That's why the declarations of the two functors is nearly identical. The difference 
    between the two shows up in the definitions. In the pseudocode found in Figure 4 you'll find that the major 
    difference is how h and t are dealt with. For this bit of pseudocode t represents the last element of the list 
    and h represents the rest of the remaining elements of the list. You'll find as you examine Figure 4 that while 
    foldl moves from the head element to the tail element, foldr moves from the tail element to the head element. 
    That's why you will see the h and t variables switching places if you compare the last clause of foldl with 
    the last clause of foldr.
</p>
<h3>Unfold</h3>
<p>
    While the fold functors accumulate a list of values into a single value, unfold does the opposite. Unfold 
    produces a potentially infinite set of results from a set of initial values called the seed. That set may 
    have only one element.
</p>
</p>
  <aside class="left">
  <figure>
    <dfn>Unfold</dfn> - a function type where the input count is less than the output count.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig.2</figcaption>
  </aside>
<p>
<p>
    You've used unfold functors before. Think of when you've needed a pseudo-random number. When you used 
    a function to get that number, you used an unfold functor. Random number generators need a seed to 
    get started. You may not have had to proved one since there is usually a fa&ccedil;ade function provided 
    by the library writers that, by default, uses the current time in milliseconds as the seed. 
</p>
<p>
    In many languages, unfold functors that produce random numbers are called Random Number Streams since 
    after the initial seed is provided, repeated calls to the functor produces a predictable, calculable 
    result. In other words, if the same seed is used for two different calls of the functor, the same 
    results are generated in the same order.
</p>

<p>
  <aside class="right_wide">
    <figcaption>Fig.5 - The declaration and definition <br>of a naive unfold functor.</figcaption>
  <figure>
    $$\begin{align*}
  unfold\text{ }&::\text{ }c\text{ }s\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{u,r\})\rightarrow [r]\\
  unfold\text{ }&::\text{ }c\text{ }s\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{u,r\})\rightarrow\\
  &[]\text{ } when\text{ }c = 0;\\
  unfold\text{ }&::\text{ }c\text{ }s\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{u,r\})\rightarrow\\
  &\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{a,b\}\\
  &[b]\mid unfold\text{ }::\text{ }a\text{ }b\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{u,r\}) otherwise;
  \end{align*}
  $$ 
  </figure>
  </aside>
</p>
<p>
    This version of unfold is naive. It is not an infinite stream. Later in the course there is a revisit 
    of unfold when the lazy execution and stream patterns are covered in depth. Those patterns will let you 
    create a non-naive, infinite unfold functor. For now, this version of unfold will suffice.
</p>
<p>
    Notice that in this case, the second phrase of the second clause of the unfold functor is not and anti-pattern. 
    It isn't an anti-pattern because the result of the call to the lambda function can not be directly 
    included in the next call to the functor. One of the elements of the 2-tuple that is the value of the lambda 
    function needs to be prepended to the list that is the value of the unfold functor.
</p>
<p>
    As an oversimplified example of how the naive unfold could be used, think of generating the first 50 even numbers. 
    In this case the functor would be executed like this 
    \(unfold\text{ }::\text{ }50\text{ }1\text{ }(\lambda\text{ }::\text{ }c\text{ }s\rightarrow \{c-1,2\times s\})\) 
    and a list of the first 50 even numbers would be the value.
</p>

  <h2>The Laws</h2>
  <p>
    For functors there are laws that must be followed if a something 
    is to be a functor. While these laws are often expressed in an arcane way, 
    explanations of the laws are included here to make them easier to apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please remember that functors were originally defined in the Category Theory branch of mathematics. A 
    category can be thought of as a grouping of things. Any category may have 0 or more elements. That's 
    why functors in functional programming always act on lists. Those lists may have 0, 1, or more elements, 
    but the functor applies a list of functions to a list of values of some type. The items in the list may  
    also be of type \(function\) since functions are first-class citizens.&#128526;
  </p>
  <h3>Laws that Determine if Something is a Functor</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>\(map\text{ }::\text{ }a\text{ }id = a\) <p>
      This rule states that the functor must be able to map an identity function to a value and not change 
      the value. The value may be a list of values or any other grouping.
    </p></li>
    <li>
      \(map\text{ }::\text{ }a\text{ }(f\circ g) = (map\text{ }::\text{ }a\text{ }f)\circ (map\text{ }::\text{ }a g)\)<p>
        This rule states that the functor must be able to apply a composed function and achieve the same 
        results as applying the individual functions individually.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
