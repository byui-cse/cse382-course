  Lists are a fundamental data structure in all strongly functional programming languages. Because of this, it is 
  very important to understand the patterns functional languages use to deal with the many ways lists need to be 
  used when writing code. There are many postings on the internet by people who don't understand that 
  functional programming languages work with lists differently than other languages. Because of this lack of 
  understanding, they draw false conclusions about the speed and memory footprint of applications written in 
  functional programming languages.
</p>
<p>
  This week we'll dive deep into how functional programming lists work and are worked on by functions. This 
  will forearm you with acurate information. This does not mean you should engage in strong discussions or 
  arguments regarding 'what language is best.' Such discussions are meaningless since no scope is given. 
  These types of arguments are a form of contention. 
</p>
<p>
	In 1989, President Nelson gave <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1989/04/the-canker-of-contention?lang=eng">a conference talk</a> about how arguments 
	destroy us. In the address he taught,
	<blockquote>
		<span>As we dread any disease that undermines the health of the body, so should we deplore contention, which is a corroding canker of the spirit. I appreciate the counsel of Abraham Lincoln, who said:

"Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time for personal contention. ... Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him." (Letter to J. M. Cutts, 26 Oct. 1863, in Concise Lincoln Dictionary of Thoughts and Statements, comp. and arr. Ralph B. Winn, New York: New York Philosophical Library, 1959, p. 107.)</span>
	</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
  It is possible, and good, to have a discussion around 'my opinion as to what could be a good language' for 
  some specific situation, but arguing over some arbitrary best language isn't pointless, it is destructive.
</p>
<h2>Internal Pieces</h2>
<p>
  All languages, functional or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17826380/what-is-difference-between-functional-and-imperative-programming-languages">imperative</a>, implement lists in similar ways by simulating mathematical nodes and edges. You may recognize these terms from working with lists, trees, and graphs 
  in your study of Discrete Mathematics, algorithms, or other mathematical reading you have done. Yet, there is a difference between those mathematical definitions and the ones 
  implemented in computing.
</p>
	<aside class="right">

		<img src="images/node.png" alt="the value and next portions of a node"> 
		<figcaption>Fig.1 - The two parts of a node, the value storage and next indicator.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</aside>
<p>
  Each node consists of two parts - memory for the storage of the list element and memory 
  that indicates the location of the next node in the list. Anything can be a value in a list element. It could be 
  data as simple as a single character or as complicated as you can imagine. Many languages allow you to store 
  different types of elements in the same list. Others require all elements of the list to be of the same 
  type. Regardless of if your language's list content rules are restrictive or expansive, the list nodes have a common, basic structure.
</p>
<p>
	 As with all things in computing, nodes and their associated lists need to be used with discretion. If you 
	 don't need a list, don't use one. When you need a list, don't try to force something else into your 
	 code. This is a good pattern to follow for all of the data structures you will learn about during this semester 
	 and beyond.
</p>
	<aside class="left">
	<figure>
		<img src="images/two_nodes.png" alt="two nodes with elements 'f' and 'a' made into a list"> 
		<figcaption>Fig.2 - A next indicator showing that the node with the element 'f' has a next node with the element 'a'.</figcaption>
	</figure>
	</aside>
<p>
	In this course, diagrams of collections using nodes will use the arrow to indicate that a node has a next node. If there is no arrow, 
	there is no next node and the end of the list has been reached. Figure 2 follows this pattern. In the figure 
	there are two nodes making up the entire list. The characters 'f' and 'a' have been stored in the list. The 
	node containing the element 'a' is the next node for the node containing the element 'f'. 
</p>
<p>
	It is useful to understand how these nodes are used to make lists in both imperative and functional programming 
	languages. Especially when you are trying to decide what language or type of language would be a good option 
	for writing all or part of a specific application.
</p>
<h3>Functional Programming Lists</h3>
<p>
	A fundamental principle of functional programming is that once a value has been stored in a variable, the value 
	can not be changed. Values can be anything. That includes lists. Yet lists need to grow, merge, and get values 
	removed from them. There appears to be a problem. How can the modification needs of lists align with the 
	principle that values are fixed?
</p>
<p>
	The naive, easy, but computationally and memory expensive, way is to make a copy of the list every time you want to 
	change it. Ouch. This is not a good choice. The creators of functional programming languages know this. That's 
	why they got outside of the box and found a solution.
</p>
<h4>Appending Lists</h4>
<p>
	Consider the two lists in Figure 3. List A has the characters 'b','i',and 'g' stored in it. List B has the characters 'f','a',and 'd' stored in it.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/independent_lists.png" alt="Lists A and B with their elements as independent lists">
  <figcaption>Figure 3. - Lists A and B with their elements.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Appending the lists to form a list C, <kbd>A:B&#10230;C</kbd>, using the functional programming pattern requires only copying list A, not both. List A had to be copied since the last element was changed to refer to the first 
	node in List B. List B doesn't need to be copied since it wasn't changed.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/two_appended_lists.png" alt="List B appended to A to form list C">
  <figcaption>Figure 4. - List C, <kbd>A:B&#10230;C</kbd>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Copying all of list A may seem like a big waste of memory and computation time, but please keep in mind that 
	merging two lists of significant size is not a common programming behavior, let alone a functional programming 
	one. If your app, in any language, is written to merge large lists, it is designed wrong and needs a good 
	reworking. Let's look at another example of the impact of the accepted functional programming pattern.
</p>
<h4>Modifying a Value in a List</h4>
<p>
	Say you want to change a value in a list. What happens then? Imagine you had a list named N storing the numbers 
	7, 13, 0, 5, -3, and 15 in that order and you wanted to change the 0 to be 6 and named the changed List U, 
	<kbd>f::0 6 N &#10230;U</kbd> where <kbd>f</kbd> is a function that modifies N. The third node, containing the 
	value 0, has to be changed. Therefore it has to be copied and modified. That triggers a cascade of requirements 
	to copy all of the proceeding nodes. The list U, then, consists of copies of the first two nodes, a copied node 
	updated to contain the value 6, and three uncopied nodes from list N like you see in Figure 5.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/modified_list.png" alt="List N modified to be List U">
  <figcaption>Figure 5. - List U,the modified version of list N.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Again, this type of behavior is expensive in ALL types of languages and should be avoided if at all possible 
	in all languages. Both of these behaviors are included in the list pattern for all languages so they are 
	available if there is no other way to create what you need. Rarely is that the case.
</p>
<h4>Prepending a Value to a List</h4>
<p>
	Now let's take a look at a list behavior where functional programming really shines. Imagine you wanted to 
	prepend the value 50 to the begining of list N and call the result P, <kbd>50:N&#10230;P</kbd>. In Figure 6 you see that no copying 
	is required. All that is needed is to create a node to contain the value 50 and have it refer to the first 
	node in list N. Done!  
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="images/prepend_list.png" alt="The value 50 prepended to list N">
  <figcaption>Figure 5. - The value 50 prepended to list N.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Notice that list N still has a value of 0 in its third node, not 6. That's because all modifications for 
	lists in functional programming languages, including the value change done above, are non-destructive. 
	Any change you make doesn't destroy the original list unlike non-functional languages such as Python. 
	Non-destructive list modification is very helpful, especially when you are writing concurrent code. 
	(More on that later in another course.)
</p>

<aside class="left">
	If you are interested in concurrent computing, and let's face it...who isn't &#128526, BYU-Idaho offers 
	a course subsequent to this one you can take. It is
	<a href="https://www.byui.edu/catalog#/courses/SkofRwwbI?bc=true&bcCurrent=Massively%20Parallel%20Computation&bcGroup=Computer%20Science&bcItemType=Courses">CSE 481</a>. 	
</aside>
<h4>Appending a Value to a List</h4>
<p>
	Having seen that when you modify a value in a list a cascade of copying is triggered of all previous 
	nodes in a list, it should come as no suprise that appending to a list triggers the same behavior. Let's 
	append a 75 to list N and put the result in list E, <kbd>N:75&#10230;E</kbd>.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/append_list.png" alt="The value 75 appended to list N">
  <figcaption>Figure 6. - The value 75 appended to list N.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Notice in Figure 6 that every node in list N was copied. This is very expensive. That's why, if you are building a 
	list by repeatedly adding elements to the list, most functional programming languages urge you to not 
	build lists by repeated appending. Instead, if you need the appended list ordering, they advise you to 
	prepend each additional value to a list and then reverse the list. That makes only one copy and 
	then when the function in which this copy is made, the memory for the original list is freed up. 
</p>
<p>
	This reversing of the list does require a temporary increase in the amount of memory being used and 
	has a cost computationally. The developers of the Erlang language and compiler stated that they 
	have resolved the 'appending problem' in their latest, as of 2020, version of Erlang. They advise 
	Erlang programmers to preppend when that makes sense engineering-wise, and append otherwise.&#128077;
</p>
<h4>Removing Values</h4>
<p>
	Along with adding a value to the begining of a list, a very common behavior is removing, usually repeatedly as 
	part of a recursive function, the head of a list <kbd>f::N &#10230;h|t</kbd>. Here <kbd>h</kbd> is the first 
	element of the original list, the head, and <kbd>t</kbd> is the rest of the original list, the tail.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/head_remove_list.png" alt="t pointing at the second value in list N">
  <figcaption>Figure 7. - The tail, <kbd>t</kbd>, of the list after retrieving the head value.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	It is unsuprising that this very common behavior is highly optimized. Notice that list t contains 
	no copies and list N has not been modified.
</p>
<p>
	Removing a value from the end of a list is a very different matter. Let R be the list N with the last element 
	removed, <kbd>f::N&#10230;R</kbd> where <kbd>f</kbd> is a function that removes the last element from N.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/tail_remove_list.png" alt="All values of N except the last duplicated">
  <figcaption>Figure 7. - R consists of copies of all of list N's nodes except the last.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	For the list R to end before list N does, the next to the last element of N has to be copied and modified. 
	This, again, triggers a cascade of copies and changes for all of the nodes of N that are before the next 
	to the last one. This behavior is expensive and should be engineered out of applications if at all possible.
</p>

<h3>Non-Functional Programming Lists</h3>
<p>
	So now, let's compare what you've learned about how functional programming languages create, modify, and use 
	lists with non-functional programming languages of which Python is one. In these languages lists are 
	usually NOT a fundimental part of the language. Often they are an addition in some sort of library you 
	can choose to include in your application or not. This second-class status does not always relegate 
	these lists to the dust bin. Let's take a look at how these languages treat lists following the same order 
	of exploration as we did with functional programming language lists.
</p>
<p>
	Before diving in please understand that values, including lists, in non-functional programming languages 
	can be changed. Take Python as an example. There you can change the values of variables all you want. Also, 
	when you use list methods like append, remove, pop, sort, and others, the original list is changed. This 
	is a destructive use of the list since the list as it was originally no longer exists. Because of this, the 
	images below will have a before and after section showing you how the list(s) have changed.
</p>
<h4>Appending Lists</h4>
<p>
	Let's use the same two lists, A and B, that we did before. Just like before, A contains the characters 
	'b','i', 'g' and B contains the characters 'f', 'a', and 'd'. Let C be the list that is B appended to 
	A, <kbd>A:B&#10230;C</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
	What happens when C is created, is that, without duplication, the last element of list A is changed 
	so that it refers to the first element of list B. This means that there is no list A that ends as 
	it did previously. This is why merging lists in this non-functional way is destructive. A, by itself, 
	can no longer be used. That's why it would be dangerous to keep the A list variable around. Using it 
	would lead to a lot of serious bugs in the code. Destructive modification also has a lot of serious 
	implications for concurrent applications. That's why the A list variable has been removed from Figure 8. 
	It's what you have to do in these languages to keep the bugs at bay. 
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_two_appended_lists.png" alt="No nodes are duplicated only one is altered">
  <figcaption>Figure 8. - List C consists of all of list A's and all of list B's nodes.</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Modifying a Value in a List</h4>
<p>
	This time, let's reuse the list N to show how non-functional modification works. Initially N contains 
	the numbers 7, 13, 0, 5, -3, and 15 in that order. As before, let's change the 0 to be a 6.
</p>
<p>
	What happens here is called 'modify in place.' That means no new list is created,<kbd>f:: 0 6 N&#10230;N</kbd>. 
	Instead, the node containing the 0 value is modified to contain a 6 instead as you can see in Figure 9.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_modified_list.png" alt="No nodes are duplicated only the one originally 
  containing 0 is altered">
  <figcaption>Figure 9. - List N modified in place.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Again, this is  destructive modification because the original list containing a 0 value no longer exists.
</p>

<h4>Prepending a Value to a List</h4>
<p>
	It is possible to do a non-destructive prepend to a non-functional programming list. This, however is 
	rarely done since it would break the pattern. It would be bad engineering-wise to have some actions on a 
	list be destructive and others not. It would be too hard to remember which actions do what. So prepending 
	50 to N is destructive, <kbd>50:N&#10230;N</kbd>.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_prepend_list.png" alt="No nodes are duplicated only the one originally 
  containing 0 is altered">
  <figcaption>Figure 10. - List N modified in place.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Notice in Figure 10 that list N has it's 0 value replace by a 6 due to the previous modification. If you go 
	back and examine this same change in the functional programming section, you will find that the value is 
	still 0 since that change was non-destructive.
</p>
<h4>Appending a Value to a List</h4>
<p>
	It is no suprise that appending the value 75 to N is also destructive, <kbd>N:75&#10230;N</kbd>.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_append_list.png" alt="No nodes are duplicated only the one originally 
  containing 0 is altered">
  <figcaption>Figure 11. - List N modified in place.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Notice yet again that, in Figure 11, the list N starts off with all of the modifications due to the 
	previous actions that are part of this tutorial.
</p>

<h4>Removing Values</h4>
<p>
	Once again, let's use <kbd>h</kbd> to represent the head value. Being destructive, this behavior 
	does not produce a tail, <kbd>f::N &#10230;h|N</kbd>.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, the N variable is changed to refer to what was the second node in the list and the 
	memory for the first node is freed up for reuse after the value it contains is stored in a variable.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_head_remove_list.png" alt="t pointing at the second value in list N">
  <figcaption>Figure 12. - The list N after removing the head value.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Lastly let's see how to destructively remove a value from the end of a list, <kbd>f::N&#10230;N</kbd>.
</p>
<figure>
  <img src="images/non-functional_tail_remove_list.png" alt="the second to the last node is modified to 
  refer to nothing">
  <figcaption>Figure 13. - N is the result of removing its last node and freeing the memory for that 
  node.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
	Here, once again, the memory for the removed node is freed for reuse. Also, what was previously the 
	next-to-last node in N is modified to refer to nothing. That way the end of the list is known. Not 
	doing this is a common bug that can lead to crashes and security exploits.
</p>
<h3>Wrap Up</h3>
<p>
	So there you have it. These are some of the most common behaviors with lists. There are others, for 
	example sorting and inserting or removing something from the middle of a list, but those behaviours 
	follow the same sort of things you've seen here in this reading. There is a lot that you've been 
	shown here. It will probably take a good amount of time with you playing around with sketches of lists 
	to more completely understand the implications of how functional and non-functional lists are treated in various languages.
