<h2>The Lazy Evaluation Pattern</h2>
<p>
  Doing computation right now is the way most programmers think and most programming languages work by default. This 
  eager computation has, for the most part, been a good thing. It is, however, not the only possibility and that 
  other possibility opens up a world of computation that can allow what otherwise would use too much memory to be 
  feasible. 
</p>
<p>
  Consider this situation. As part of some calculation, 100,000,000,000 sequential odd numbers are needed one at a 
  time or in small groups. Calculating all 100,000,000,000 ahead of time is very costly memory-wise, especially if 
  some of them end up never being used for one reason or another. If each number or group of numbers was calculated 
  only at the time they were needed, then this memory problem goes away. This contrived, simple example is not the 
  only time such calculations occur.
</p>

<p>
  It is very common in applications that display a lot of items to wait to retrieve additional items until 
  it is apparent that the user will be looking at the next item or items soon. That way computational resources 
  such as memory, CPU, and network bandwidth aren't wasted on items that will never be seen.
</p>
<p>
  It is important to understand that this delayed, or lazy, loading is not the only way lazy evaluation can be of 
  use. Any time you have returned a lambda that is used as some sort of delayed evaluation, you have applied lazy 
  evaluation. That lambda was probably stored and, if your computational flow determined it was needed, evaluated 
  later.
