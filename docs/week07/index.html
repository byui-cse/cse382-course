<h2>It Can be Good to be Lazy</h2>
<p>
  Lazy evaluation, is common in some languages and not in others. The idea behind it is this. "Why use resources to compute something until the time you actually need it?"
</p>
<p>
  In this way it is similar to Just In Time (JIT), also known as lean, factory management. Why spend the money to store product when the factory could schedule the production of the product just in time to ship it? Most of the products you use today are produced in factories that follow lean management principles. 
</p>
<p>
  Consider this computing situation. You are using a language that has a range structure. It allows you to create a range of numbers using a single function call. Using pseudocode it looks like this. \(range\ ::\ i\rightarrow Range\).
</p>

<p>
  So the range function returns a Range of Ints, a list with elements 0 through i, right? If the \(Range\) uses lazy computation, the answer is no. Why use the CPU time and memory required to hold the entire list? Why not set up the \(Range\) to include only the elements asked for later when they are needed?
</p>
<aside class="left">

    <dfn>Lazy Evaluation</dfn> - delaying calculation until the time the result of the calculation is needed by some 
    other calculation.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 1</figcaption>
</aside>
<p>If the \(Range\) had 3 billion elements, would you really want to use enough RAM to hold 3 billion elements before you even get a chance to do anything with the first element of the list? Probably not. Instead the \(Range\) could produce only those items you are needing as they are needed. This means if you could even access the elements of the \(Range\) out of order only those access would be created. Lazy evaluation lets these types of behaviors happen.</p>
<p>
  As with everything, lazy evaluation can come with some drawbacks. It can increase the space complexity of a calculation in some circumstances. It can also be difficult to calculate the time complexity of a function that uses something that is lazy or is lazy itself. As with everything, choose wisely. Lazy evaluation isn't the answer to all you computing needs.
</p>

<h2>Lazy Lambdas</h2>
<p>
  There are two types of lazy lambdas, the first you are already familiar with. They have one or more parameters 
  and you've used them when doing currying, passing lambdas to be used later, and returning lambdas from functions. 
  Let's call these impure lazy lambdas.
</p>
<p>
  What, then, would a pure lazy lambda be? One without parameters. To think of a silly, simple example, a function called 
  \(lazy\_add\) that has two parameters and a pure lambda for a value.
</p>
    \[
    \begin{align*}
    -spec\ lazy\_add\ &::\ a\ b\rightarrow\lambda\ ::\\
    lazy\_add\ &::\ a\ b\rightarrow (\lambda\ ::\ \rightarrow a+b).
    \end{align*}
    \]
<p>
   In most languages addition is done eagerly but this \(lazy\_add\) function doesn't actually add the numbers. What it does do is create a lambda that will add the numbers at a later time when the lambda is executed. Since the value of the lambda's value is the sum of the 
  two numbers, it would be as if the 'raw' addition was done later.
</p>
<p>
  This silly and simple example of a pure lazy lambda should not be viewed as an judicious replacement for all 
  eager addition. The only time it might be useful would be if the two numbers were very large and the adding of 
  those numbers would have a negative speed or memory impact on the immediate calculation. Again, this is a silly example 
  created to reveal the principle.
</p>
<p>
  A more reasonable example of where pure lazy lambdas might be useful is when doing database access, a 
  computationally expensive behavior. It is highly feasible that one or more variants of a database query or update 
  should be delayed and executed later. The queries or updates could be wrapped in pure lazy lambdas and then, when 
  more data is known regarding which should be used, the appropriate lambda could be selected and executed.
</p>
<p>
  As with impure lazy lambda's, the possible applications of pure lazy lambdas is bounded only by imagination 
  and need.
</p>

<h2>Oh What Can We Do?!</h2>
<p>
  Consider this situation, you need to represent an infinite set of even numbers for use in a function. Computers are definitely finite things. Oh no!
</p>
<p>
  Don't panic. If you've ever used a pseudo-random number generator, you've used an apparently infinite set of numbers. Be aware! Any pseudo-random number generator has a limited number of times you can request another number before it resets and starts over. In other words, pseudo-random number generators are periodic. This periodicity is caused by the algorithm used to calculate the next pseudo-random number lazily.
</p>
<p>
  When the lazy evaluation being done only allows access to the 'next' element, evaluation is referred to as a stream. The analogy is that when you are standing in a lake where a stream ends, you get the next bit of water the stream has. You don't get to skip any.
</p>
<p>
  Below is an inelegant, anti-pattern for a stream that produces positive even numbers beyond some given starting point.
</p>
<p>
\[\begin{align*}
-spec\ pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow \{Int,(\lambda\ ::\ Int)\}\\
\\
pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed \when seed < 0\rightarrow\\
                          &pos\_evens\_stream\ 0;\\
pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed \when 1=(seed\mod 2)\rightarrow\\
                          &pos\_evens\_stream\ seed-1;\\

pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow\\
                          &\{seed+2,(\lambda\ ::\ \rightarrow pos\_evens\_stream\ seed+2)\}

\end{align*}
\]
</p>
<p>
  If you wanted to work with the infinite set of even numbers, the initial seed would be \(0\). The initial and subsequent uses would look like this.
</p>
<p>
\[\begin{align*}
&(pos\_evens\_stream\ 0)\looparrowright \{even\_num,get\_next\}\\
&get\_next\ \looparrowright \{another\_even, get\_another\}
\end{align*}
\]
</p>
<p>
  Using this is awkward. Too many variables have to be created when the tuple being returned by \(pos\_evens\_stream\) is decomposed. This is why this is an anti-pattern. There is a better way.
</p>
<h3>Using Concurrency for Streams</h3>
<p>
  Consider approaching streams this way. Concurrency in all modern languages allow some sort of communication between concurrently executing code. Often this is done with bi-directional message passing. There are other ways for this communication to happen, but they tend to be bug-ridden and can cause a lot of unnecessary crashing.
</p>
<p>
  When a functional programming language's concurrency allows for bi-directional message passing, a well designed function that is being run concurrently executes a library blocking function as one of its lines of code. This way, the function can wait for some data or some other message before proceeding, sending a response, and then completing.
</p>
<p>
  If such a function calls itself recursively an elegant stream pattern emerges.
</p>

<p>
\[\begin{align*}
-spec\ pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow ok\\
\\
pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed \when seed < 0\rightarrow\\
                          &pos\_evens\_stream\ 2;\\
pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed \when 1=seed\pmod 2\rightarrow\\
                          &pos\_evens\_stream\  seed-1;\\
pos\_evens\_stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow\\
                          &await\ \rightarrow\\
                          &\quad seed\\
                          &pos\_evens\_stream\ seed+2.
\end{align*}
\]
</p>
<p>
  In this pseudo-code, the language's blocking library function is called \(await\). When used in a concurrent function, the result of the calculation after await is returned to the calling function. Then \(pos\_evens\_stream\) calls itself with a new value for \(seed\). In this case, \(seed\) is known as the \(state\) of the function.
</p>
<p>
  Each language's concurrency library will also have not only makes a function like \(pos\_evens\_stream\) execute concurrently but also has a value that is some sort of identifier for the concurrent process so messages can be passed. This identifier is sometimes called a handle. This is so the handle can be passed as a parameter to functions that will need to do bi-directional message passing with the concurrently executing function. 
</p>
<h2>Generalization of the Pattern</h2>
<p>
  There are many ways such a stream can be created. A common way is to have the stream exist in its own 
  computational unit, be that a thread, process, network resource, or some other unit that accomplishes the 
  processing required to generate the next value or group of values. The choice of what type of computational unit to choose depends on the language selected and the situation 
  within which the stream exists among other possibilities.
</p>

<p>
  Regardless of which of these computational units is selected, the function doing the computation follows the 
  same generalized pattern. 
  <ol>
    <li>
      The stream consists of a recursive function with at least one parameter of a type required to do the generation of the stream value(s) called a seed. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Each recursive call updates the value of a seed-type value and passes it to the next recursive call 
      of itself.
    </li>
    <li>
      Each recursive call blocks (waits) until a request is made for the next value or set of values.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recursion continues until the request made is for termination of the stream or, if the stream is non-infinite, a value after the last value is requested.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
\[
    \begin{align*}
    stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow a\\
    stream\ &::\ seed\rightarrow \\
        &request\leftarrow await\\
        &f\ seed\rightarrow next\_seed\\
        &respond\ next\_seed\\
        &next\_seed\text{ when }request\text{ is termination}\\
        &stream\ next\_seed\text{ otherwise}.
    \end{align*}
    \]
<p>
  Following this pattern, a function could be a stream producing prime numbers. It could be producing even numbers. 
  It could be a stream accessing a database and supplying data. It could be a stream accessing a network or 
  Internet node and supplying data. For a step in a factory, it could be computing which piece of partially completed product should be worked on next. In the world of Internet software creation, such a stream would be 
  called a micro-service. The options are limitless. 
</p>
<h2>Wrap Up</h2>
<p>
  The principle of lazy evaluation is powerful. When followed it can save a lot of wasted computation time and space. Following the stream pattern can be a good way of leveraging lazy evaluation when a large series of values need to be generated.
