<h2>The Curse of Complicatedness</h2>
<p>
  One of the biggest problems that exists in software engineering today is uncontrolled complicatedness. The 
  size and complicatedness of libraries, applications, and systems has continued to grow exponentially while at the same time, the 
  number of libraries, applications, and systems grows. The patterns for this week exist to help reduce this complicatedness at all of these 
  levels, both those of size and those of number.
</p>
<p>
  The previous readings all dealt with patterns for individual functions. This week, the patterns are regarding how to have groups of functions that can work together more cleanly, with less complicatedness, and more beautifully. The two groups for this week are monoids and monads.
</p>

  <h2>Monoids</h2>
  <p>
    A monoid is an organized bunch of functions that follow a few simple rules.
    The bunch of functions
    <ol>
      <li>all have one parameter of a single type,</li>
      <li>value type matches the parameter type,</li>
      <li>is closed under composition, </li>
      <li>the functions are associative, and</li>
      <li>there is a unit, or identity, value for the bunch of functions.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The word bunch was chosen specifically. It implies some sort of association that isn't used in common 
    programming <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parlance">parlance</a> like list, set, or 
    collection are. You can have any type of bunch, and as long as the functions in the bunch follow the rules for 
    being a monoid, the bunch of functions is a monoid.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mathematical description of the group of functions is that it is a <a href="https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Semigroup+(mathematics)" target="_blank">semi-group</a> for which there is an identity value. Some of the rules listed above are inherited since any monoid is a semi-group.
  </p>
  <p>
    You've composed functions A LOT up to this point in your life in the code you've written. Week 05's 
    map-filter-reduce example is just one time out of many when you've done so. Any time you have called a function 
    and then passed the result of that function call to another function or operator, you have done composition.
  </p>
  </p>
  <aside class="left">

    <dfn>Monoid Pattern</dfn> - a group of functions that follow the monoid rules used to reduce the amount of unique, un-reused code in an application or library and aid in producing concurrent applications.

  </aside>
  <p>
  <p>
    Say you had two functions, \(g\ ::\ a\rightarrow a\) and \(f\ ::\ a\rightarrow a\). 
    If you call \(g\) and then pass the result to \(f\) you've composed the two functions. You may have used an intermediate 
    variable when you've done this, or maybe you didn't. It makes no difference. You did function composition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is one common way to express that composition. \(f\circ g\). Now, if you think about it, \(f\circ g\) could 
    be thought of as just another function. You could have written one function and included the code from \(f\) 
    and \(g\) in it. It would, more than likely, be bad to do so...but you could have. So you can view \(f\circ g\) 
    as if it was a function named \(h\) and \(h\) would be equivalent to  \(f\circ g\), or stated more succinctly, \(h\equiv 
    f\circ g\). Remember that \(g\ ::\ a\rightarrow a\) and \(f\ ::\ a\rightarrow a\). It then follows that \(h\) has a parameter of type \(a\), a value of type \(a\) and a declaration of \(h\ ::
    \ a\rightarrow a\). As \(h\equiv 
    f\circ g\), it follows that \(f\circ g\ ::\ a\rightarrow a\).

  <p>
    It is common among programmers to compose functions where the values of the functions are different. You've 
    done this before. Maybe you started with an \(Integer\) and, after having used two or more functions ended up 
    with an \(Float\) or some other sort of change. It is not OK for functions in monoids to have non-matching 
    types. You could have a monoid and then pass the results of chaining several of those monoidal functions to one that has a different value type. That way your functions can compose without issue. But what about meta-data?
  </p>
  
  <h2>Monads</h2>
  <p>
    Monads are all about meta-data. Meta-data is data about the data. For example, consider the list \([1,2,3,4,5]\). One piece of meta-data describing the list is its length, \(5\). Another could be its average, or its sum, or anything else that is important to know regarding lists in your application.
  </p>
  <p>
    As pieces of data move through your application, meta-data about them can be passed with them if the data and the meta-data are included together in some combined type like a 2-tuple, 3-tuple, n-tuple, dictionary, list, tree, etc. One common piece of meta-data is whether a computation worked or failed. Examples of needing this meta-data could be when you are accessing data from or storing data in untrustworthy locations such as databases, users, files, or any other data source. These data storage and source items are side effects, though monads can be used for much more than dealing with side effects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since users, databases, web access points and any other type of 
    input or output are all side effects and are all untrustworthy it would be nice to know if the request for storage or access of data worked or failed. You can write a monad type a and a set of functions who's values are the monad type to help you more readily deal with this situation. Monoids just can't pull that off. Another ability of any monad you create is the functions that are part of that monad can be combined together in an way that is similar to function composition.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Let's first look at monad consisting of a generic monad type and a set of single parameter functions who's value is that monad type.
    As you read earlier, a monoid has a description like this \(f\ ::\ a\rightarrow b\). A function that is part of a 
    monad has a description that looks like this 
    \(f\ ::\ a\rightarrow Mb\). There is that small but very important change from \(b\) to 
    \(Mb\). What does that change mean? What is the meaning of \(M\)?
  </p>

  <aside class="right">
  <figure>
    <dfn>Monad Pattern</dfn> - a type and a group of unary functions that produce that type which are closed under binding, one of 
    which is an identity function, to reduce the amount of complicatedness caused by side effects in
    applications.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 2</figcaption>
  </aside>
  <p>
    Those are two very good questions. Let's start by defining \(Mb\). In the above example, \(Mb\) is some type of wrapper, of your choice, around \(b\). The \(Mb\) could be a 2-tuple, a 3-tuple, a n-tuple, a dictionary, list, or any other containing type as discussed earlier. 
    \(Mb\) is specific to the need and is designed and written by you. It may be 
    the result of accessing a database to build the \(Mb\). It may be the result of getting data from the user to build the \(Mb\). 
    It may be the result of code that calculates meta-data from the data and builds a \(Mb\). It can be A LOT of 
    different things.
  </p>
  <p>
    For functions in a monoid, their value is a direct computation resulting from the value of the parameter. 
    For functions in a monad, their value is a wrapped element \(Mb\). How these functions do this varies depending on what the types of the parameters of the monadal functions. 
    Reread the two previous sentences many times until you understand the difference..because they are 
    significantly different.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the 3 functions below, \(f, g,\text{ and }h\), that are part of a monad. 
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\begin{align*}
    f\ &::\ a\rightarrow Mb\\
    g\ &::\ b\rightarrow Mc\\
    h\ &::\ c\rightarrow Md\\

    \end{align*}\)
  </p>
  <p>
    Notice that it appears that you might be able to compose these functions together. That appearance is 
    a lie.&#128561; They can't be composed because composition requires the value of the first function to match the 
    type of the second. The monad type \(Mb\) is not the same type as \(b\). Therefore, \(Mb\) can not 
    be passed to \(g\ ::\ b\rightarrow Mc\), regardless of what \(Mb\) does under 
    the hood. Composition is out! What, then, can we do to link these functions together in a way somewhat 
    similar to composition with monoids?
  </p>
  <h3>Binding</h3>
  <p>
    For a monad to be a monad, the functions making up the monad must be closed under what is called binding. To 
    make it easier to understand binding, we'll use this symbol, \(\ggg \), to represent binding.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the functions \(f,g\), and \(h\) above. Binding these three functions would result in the following situation.
  </p>
  <p>
    \((f\ggg g\ggg h)\ ::\ Ma\rightarrow Md\)
  </p>
  <p>
    Its as if there was a function that had a parameter that was \(a\) and had a value that was \(Md\), though no such function exists. In this way it is similar to function composition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice the similarities and differences between binding and the composition of three similar monoidal functions.
    \((f\circ g\circ h)\ ::\ a\rightarrow d\)
  </p>
  <p>
    One major difference is that functions bound together have as their value a monadal type, not just a raw computed value.
  </p>
  <p>
    What then does the function declaration look like for this mysterious bind function? Well...monads have to be designed for specific situations. Let's design a bind function for a monad that helps us deal with successful vs unsuccessful computations. Let's call this the <kbd>maybe</kbd> monad. Let's have the monad type for <kbd>maybe</kbd> be a 2-tuple where the first tuple element is either \(ok\) or \(fail\) indicating success or failure. Bind, in this case, is then
  </p>

  <p>
    \(\begin{align*}
    maybe\_bind\ ::&\ Ma\ f\rightarrow Mb\\
    \\
    maybe\_bind\ ::&\ Ma\ f\rightarrow\\
    &Ma\looparrowright \{ok\_fail,a\}\\
    &case\\
    &\quad ok\_fail = ok\rightarrow\\
    &\quad\quad f\ a\\
    &\quad otherwise\rightarrow \{fail,a\}. 
    \end{align*}\)
  </p>
  <p>
    The value of the \(maybe\_bind\) function is the value of the \(f\) function which is any of the  functions that are part of the <kbd>maybe </kbd>monad.
  </p>
  <p>
    For <kbd>maybe</kbd> to be a monad, there must also be an \(id\) function(see the rules below) that wraps raw data in a monadal type. For the <kbd>maybe</kbd> id function is
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\begin{align*}
    maybe\_id\ ::&\ a\rightarrow Ma\\
    maybe\_id\ ::&\ a\rightarrow\\
    &\{ok, a\}.
    \end{align*}\)
  </p>
  <p>
    for any \(a\) of any type.
  </p>
  <p>
    These functions are fine and dandy, but look what it would look like to use them. Imagine that a is a URL string. The code 
    to bind the three functions \(f, g, \text{ and } h\) in that order with the URL is this.
  </p>
  <p>
    \(maybe\_bind\ ::\ (maybe\_bind\ ::\ (maybe\_bind\ ::\ (maybe\_id\ ::\ \text{"http://www.somename.com"}) f) g) h\).
  </p>
  <p>
    Ughhh! That's a variation of the example of ugly code from week 05!&#128552; Also, since the monad could consist of any number of functions, not just the three in this example, using \(maybe\_bind\) gets even uglier to use as more functions are bound. Let's fix it by applying the same solution 
    we used in week 05. Chaining!&#129395; 
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's make a version of the <kbd>chain</kbd> function that can be used with any monad we choose to create in the future and call it \(monad\_chain\). In the pseudocode below, let \(bind\) be the binding function for a monad and \([f]\) be a subset, proper or improper, of that monad's functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\begin{align*}
    monad\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ bind\ [f]\rightarrow Mb\\
    \\
    monad\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ \_\ []\rightarrow Ma;\\
    monad\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ bind\ [h\mid t]\rightarrow\\
    &monad\_chain\ ::\ (bind\ Ma\ h)\ bind\ t
    \end{align*}\)
  </p>
  <p>
    This version of chain has a specific weakness. Chaining continues even after a failure is indicated by a algorithm having a value with \(fail\) in the metadata. This can be resolved by creating a different chaining function as seen here.
  </p>
  <p>
    \(\begin{align*}
    maybe\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ bind\ [f]\rightarrow Mb\\
    \\
    maybe\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ \_\ []\rightarrow Ma;\\
    maybe\_chain\ ::&\ Ma\ bind\ [h\mid t]\rightarrow\\
    &Mb = bind\ Ma\ h\\
    &Mb\looparrowright \{ok\_fail,b\}\\
    &case\\
    &\quad ok\_fail = fail\\
    &\qquad \{fail,h,b\}\text{%%Put into the metadata any appropriate items for your situation.}\\
    &\quad otherwise\\
    &\qquad maybe\_chain\ ::\ Mb\ bind\ t
    \end{align*}\)
  </p>

  <p>
    This version of chaining resolves the issue of needing to check the value of each function called prior to executing the next function, an ugly anti-pattern used in many applications, libraries, and code sets.
  </p>

  <p>
    Think of the \(maybe\_chain\) version of chaining a template. You can use it to create early exit chaining for any monad. You can also include or exclude any appropriate items in the metadata that is part of the value of your chain function. This could include items such as a counter indicating which function failed, the function that failed, etc. You are limited only by your imagination and what is appropriate for the monad.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using this version of <kbd>chain</kbd> with our example <kbd>maybe</kbd> monad is much cleaner. 
  </p>
  <p>
    \(monad\_chain\ ::\ (maybe\_id\ \text{"http://www.somename.com"})\ maybe\_bind\ [f,g,h]\)
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that conceptually, bind being applied to these three functions can be represented as \((f\ggg g\ggg h)\ ::\ a\rightarrow Md\) and that the end result of the binding is a monadal type, \(Md\).
  </p>

  <h2>The Architectural Pattern</h2>
  <p>
    As mentioned at the beginning of this reading, reducing the complicatedness of libraries, applications, and systems is the purpose of the monoid and monad patterns.
  </p>
  <figure style= "float:left;width:50%">
  <img src="images/sub_apps_as_monoids.png" alt="monoids or monads combined together to be sub-sections of applications">
  <figcaption>Figure 1. - Any number of monoids and/or monads can be composed or bound together to be a subsection of an application.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
  Consider Figure 1. Any sub-appliction, a logically consistant portion of an appliction, can be designed as a monoid or monad that binds together other monoids or monads. To do so, there must be a set of moniodal or monadal functions of the higher-level monoid or monad that use, via composition or binding, the functions of the underlying monoids or monads.
</p>
<p>
  Following this architectural pattern, another sub-app can be designed as a monoid or monad that uses, via composition or binding, the functions of the other underlying sub-app monoids or monads. But the pattern doesn't end there. Applications can be designed as monoids or monads using, via composition or binding, any number of sub-apps. It also follows from this pattern that sub-systems, systems, sub-networks, networks, and inter-networks can all be designed to be monoids or monads using, via composition or binding, functions of their underlying monoids or monads.
</p>
<p>
  We have explored this pattern from the bottom up. If we consider it from the top down, any inter-network, network, system, sub-system, application, or sub-application you create can be recursively designed as some combination of monoids and/or monads. Each level dealing only with a minimal amount of complicatedness.
</p>
<p>
  Think about this non-technical analogy to this architectural design. There are managers who take all the complicatedness of knowing about and dealing with every decision and interaction of all the employees they manage, be that one or multiple levels down. These managers are known by the epitaph of micromanagers. Invariably the complicatedness overwhelms them and they are less effective than they could be. But there are managers that take a very different approach.
</p>
<p>
  These managers trust their subordinates to make decisions that those subordinates can handle and for which they have responsibility. This type of manager's job is much less complicated and they tend to do a better job, as do all of those who work as subordinates, as long as this delegation of responsibility pattern is maintained by all of their subordinate managers.
</p>
<p>
  If each level of monoid or monad in an inter-network or other larger or smaller type of interacting assemblage is designed appropriately, each monoid or monad will delegate responsibility for doing appropriate work to its sub monoids or monads. Therefore, each level of any monoid or monad, from inter-network to the lowest-level substituent monoid or monad becomes much more self-documenting. Each also is only as complicated as need be, and the overall complicatedness is decreased.
</p>

  <h2>The Rules</h2>
  <p>
    For the Computer Science version of both monoids and monads, there are rules that can be applied to determine if a something 
    is one, the other, or neither of these patterns. While these rules are often expressed in an arcane way, 
    explanations of the rules are included here to make them easier to apply.
  </p>
  <h3>Rules that Determine if Something is a Monoid</h3>
  <p>
    A group, collection, set, etc. of functions is a monoid if;

      <ol>
        <li>
          The group is a semi-group.
        </li>
        <li>
          \(\text{For functions }a,b\in\mathbb{C},\exists\text{ rule } \circ\text{ such that } a\circ b \in\mathbb{C}\)<p>
            For any two functions in a group, collection, set, etc., there is a composition rule such that 
            the composition of the two functions is also in the group, collection, set, etc. The group, collection, 
            set, etc. is closed under composition.
          </p> 
        </li>
        <li>
          \(a\circ (b\circ c)\equiv(a\circ b)\circ c\)<p>
            Any set of compositional rules for the group, collection, set, etc. of functions must obey the law of 
            associativity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>\(a\circ id \equiv a\) and \(id\circ a \equiv a\)<p>
          There must exist some identity function such that composition of any element of the group, collection, set, 
          etc. with the identity produces the original function.
        </p></li>
      </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Rules that Determine if a Set of Functions is a Monad</h3>
  <p>
    A group, collection, set, etc. of functions is a monad if;

    <ol>
      <li>let \(\mathbb{F}\) be a set of functions. \(\exists\ bind\ \in\mathbb{F}\)
        <p>
          There is a composition-like function called <kbd>bind</kbd>.
        </p></li>
      <li>\( bind\ ::\ Ma\ (\lambda\ ::\ f\ a\rightarrow Mb)\rightarrow Mb\)
        <p>
          The <kbd>bind</kbd> function has as parameters a monadal type \(Ma\) and a function that has parameters of type \(a\) and a value of type \(Mb\). The value of <kbd>bind</kbd> is an \(Mb).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        let \(\ggg \text{ be equivalent to } bind. (f\ggg  g)\ggg h \equiv f\ggg (g\ggg h)\)<p>
        The <kbd>bind</kbd> function must obey the law of associativity</p>
      </li>
      <li>\(\exists\text{ function } unit:: a\rightarrow Ma\)<p>
        There is a unit function that doesn't change a raw value. It just wraps it to make it a monadal type.
      </p></li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Rules to Determine if a Monoid or Monad Should be Used</h3>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>If no metadata is needed, use a monoid.</li>
      <li>If metadata is needed, use a monad.</li>
    </ul>
