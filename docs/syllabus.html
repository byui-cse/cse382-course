    <h1>Functional Programming Data Structures and Patterns</h1>
    <p>CSE 382</p>
  </div>
</div>
	<h1>Syllabus</h1>
	<h3>Course Description</h3>
	<p>
      In this course you will have the opportunity learn about and create code for several basic functional programming data structures and patterns. As in all languages, data structures and patterns are algorithms. In functional programming languages, the code for these consists of functions.
  </p>
  <section>
	<h3>Design Principles</h3>
	<p>
      This course is based on one underlying principle; namely, that you are a
		  dedicated disciple of Jesus Christ and therefore you would never lie or make
		  deceptive claims regarding your understanding of the course material. Nor
		  would you lie or deceive regarding completion of the tasks you will be
		  assigned. Other principles include:<ul>
			<li>lifting others in the class;</li>
			<li>using your agency;</li>
			<li>showing empathy and love; and</li>
			<li>being humble enough to ask for help from your teacher and others in the class.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
        Many tasks assigned to you in this course are to be completed in teams.
        Your instructor will inform you regarding team creation. It is also true
        that you will never be given a team grade. You will be accountable to
        your team, and will report to them during class meeetings (but never
        outside of class) the results of your investigations and collaborations
        outside of class. But no tasks done outside of class will be
        instructor- or peer-reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        Teamwork is part of the BYU-Idaho Learning Model, and indeed, it is part
        of the Plan of Salvation. All of us here on earth work together to aid
        each other in achieving salvation and exaltation, yet we are
        individually responsible for our own salvation and exaltation. Nobody
        makes it to the Celestial Kingdom because they belonged to a group of
        good people. Neither should you expect to get an A just because you are
        part of a group of hardworking students that come to understand the
        topics of this course and are able to apply them.
    </p>
		<p>
        Therefore, when you are helping someone you should never give them your own work.
        Neither should you expect someone to give you theirs when you ask them for help.
			  Instead, help those who will come to you by talking over how they are
			  thinking about and approaching their tasks, showing them how to search for
			  and find answers, and be loving and supportive. In other words, teach them
        just like you would teach someone the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Love them,
        help them find their own answers, and lead them to the scriptures.</p>

	<h2>Course Structure</h2>
	<p>
      This is a semester-long course. Each week you will have reading material and a set of tasks to learn from. Each week consists of a full three class hours. During the first, new material is presented and discussed. During the second student-submitted questions regarding the new material are answered and discussed. The third day is reserved for answering any additional questions from students and completing, not starting, the team tasks for the week in a mentoring environment with the instructor as mentor.
  </p>

    To help you see and report your learning progress this table is made available to you.

	<h2>Assessment</h2>
    <h3>Late Work.</h3> 
      <p>
        Late work is accepted only if the reason is extraordinary, and acceptance is reached through private and prolonged negotiation. Also, you must come talk to me in person in my office (or in a zoom meeting if remote) â€” NOT by email, nor any other means of communication.
      </p>
    <h3>Claiming a Grade</h3>
	<p>
    Three times during the semester, you will meet with me in my office, or via Zoom if you are part of a remote class. The purpose of this meeting is for you to present your course tracker and evidence of your learning to me. After this you will make a grade-to-date claim using your evidence to support why that grade is correct. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Afterwards I will give you my thoughts on the strength of your claim. The last claim that you make, taking into account any feedback from me, will be your final grade for the course.
  </p>
    <h4>Grade Definitions</h4>
  <p>
    This class does not use the +- style of grading. Instead, use the definitions of letter grades from the University Catalog:
    <p>
<defn>A</defn> represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and extensive evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex problems. Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving other students. Note: Notice this description of A implies that you have gone above and beyond. To claim this grade, throughout the 4 week period being reviewed, you must have consistently done things similar to what you see in the list below and recorded evidence of this behavior in your portfolio. Examples of the required types of behaviors are:
<ul>
  <li>teaching and/or helping others in the class but not in your group,</li>
  <li>helping a Non-CS, Non-CE, Non-EE, Non-SE major with their home- work for a non-tech class using the principles you learned in this class,</li>
  <li>applying what you've learned in this class in another class you are
currently taking, and</li>
  <li>doing work not assigned such as writing code using what you are learn-
ing that has not been assigned, etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<defn>B</defn> represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the material which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or employment. The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.
</p>
<p>
<defn>C</defn> represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal initiative to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might prove challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.
</p>
<p>
<defn>D</defn> represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials. Retaking a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject matter.
