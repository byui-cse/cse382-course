<h2>The Tree Data Structure</h2>
<p>
  Trees follow the monad pattern. There is a group of data organized in some way, a series of functors that 
  operate on that group, and each of the rules for monad is met. That's why you'll hear, "A tree is a monad" 
  used colloquially. The more correct language would be, "Well made trees and the functions that operate on 
  them follow the monad pattern." That's a little long. Maybe we should stick with "A tree is a monad" for 
  ease of speech and just remember what we actually mean.
</p>
<p>
    For this course the functors we'll focus on are \(add\) and \(contains\). A fully fledged set 
    of functors would include other behaviors.
</p>
<h3>The Data Organization of Binary Trees</h3>

        <figcaption>Fig.1 - The three parts of a binary tree node, the value storage and two next indicators, left and right.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    </aside>
<p>
    All types of trees consist of nodes. These nodes have a value and one or more \(next\) indicators. The lists 
    you learned about in week 02 are a subset of trees where there is only one \(next\) and are called a unary 
    tree. Binary trees have two \(next\)s, these are usually referred to as next-left and next-right as you see in 
    Figure 1. 
</p>

<P>
    The order with which you code the left and right indicators is irrelevant. The indicators just need 
    to be used consistently since there is no actual \(leftness\) or \(rightness\) to the indicators. 
    That is a relic of the visualizations of trees like you see below and that you may have seen in your previous 
    coursework. In Figure 2, you see arrows representing the relationships between nodes. They go from from what is often called the parent node to the 
    child node. The parent-child relationship is actually 
    a form of 'contains' .  
</P>

    7, 12, and 15.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p>
    To say this in another way, all child nodes are sub components of their parent node. Using tuples, the diagram 
    above would describe this parent-child contains relationship more explicitly with \(nil\) meaning there is 
    no child node.

</aside>
\(
(10,(6,(2,nil,nil),(7,nil,nil)),(15,(12,nil,nil),nil))
\)
<p>
    Rather than draw out all the left and right next boxes, it is customary to use a circle to represent the node, 
    put the value in or beside the circle, and then use arrows to indicate the child nodes.
</p>
<h4>Ordering Rule For BSTs</h4>
<p>
    Binary Search Trees (BST), a special type of binary tree, have a simple ordering rule used for adding and 
    checking to see if values are in the tree. The rule is that lesser values go 'left' and greater or equal values 
    go 'right.' This rule must be followed every time you add a value so when you need to search the tree, you can 
    easily do so.
</p>
<p>
    An interesting result of this rule is that a tree can, but not always, have a different structure depending on 
    the order in which the values are added. For example, if the values 10, 6, 15, 12, 7, and 2 were added to a 
    binary tree in that order, the tree in Figure 3 would be generated. If, however, the same values were added 
    in the order 12, 15, 10, 6, 2, and 7 the tree in figure 4 would be generated.
</p>

    <figcaption>Fig.4 - A visualization of a tree whose root-node has the value 12 and the additional values 2, 6, 
    7, 10, and 15.</figcaption>
</figure>
</aside>
<p>
    In mathematics there is, for example, only one number \(2\). That's why in Mathematics \(8\div 4 =2\) means 
    that \(8\div 4\) is \(2\), not 'is the same as \(2\).' Two sets are not one set even if they contain the 
    same elements. That's why two sets containing the same elements are considered equivalent rather than equal 
    in mathematics.
</p>
<p>
    Following this same logic, two trees can not be equal. They can, however, be equivalent. Consider the trees in 
    Figures 3 and 4. They contain the same values even though their structures are different. If you were to think  
    of them as mathematical sets, the two trees would be equivalent.
</p>
<p>
    Because BSTs can so easily be thought of as sets, BST's can be used to represent mathematical sets. All that 
    is needed for a BST to act as a set is to check if a value is already in the tree before adding it to the 
    tree. If it is found that the value is already there, then don't add it. Now the BST is acting as a set.
</p>
<p>
     For \(n\in\{-1,0,1\}\), \(0\) meaning equality, \(-1\) less than, 
    and \(1\) greater than and \(comp\) being a comparator function comparing two elements of the tree, 
    the add algorithms for BSTs is:  
\[\begin{align*}
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow root\_node\\
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }nil,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &\text{ }(a,nil,nil);\\
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }node, a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &node\rightarrow (value,nextL,nextR)\\
               &if\text{ }comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,value = -1\\
               &\text{ }(value,(add\text{ }::\text{ }nextL,a, comp),nextR\\
               &else\\
               &\text{ }(value,nextL,(add\text{ }::\text{ }nextR,a,comp)).
\end{align*}\]
<p>
    The contains algorithm for BSTs is:
</p>
\[\begin{align*}
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow Boolean\\
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }nil,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
                    &\text{ }false;\\
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &node\rightarrow (value,nextL,nextR)\\
               &comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,value\rightarrow comparison\\
               &if\text{ }comparison = 0\\
               &\text{ }true\\
               &elif\text{ }comparison = -1\\
               &\text{ }contains\text{ }::\text{ }nextL,a,comp\\
               &else\\
               &\text{ }contains\text{ }::\text{ }nextR,a,comp
\end{align*}\]

<h4>Ordering Rule For Red Black Trees</h4>
<p>
    There is a problem that can arise when using BSTs. They can get into a situation where they get some 
    long branches and other short branches as in Figure 4. This type of situation means that searches can 
    end up taking a lot longer for some values as compared to others. For example, if you were to search for 
    \(7\) in Figure 4 it would require four comparisons to find it, but it would only take two comparisons 
    to find \(15\). In this small tree, the speed difference would be negligible but imagine if the left branch 
    of the tree contained 100,000 numbers and most of those were essentially in a list. Now the search for any 
    element is essentially \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) instead of \(\mathcal{O}(log n)\) as it is for a better balanced 
    tree.  
</p>
<p>
    To help overcome this problem, the BST's node is augmented with an additional piece of data, a color. The two 
    possible colors are red an black. The contains function for a red black tree is nearly identical to that for 
    a BST. The only difference is that when the elements of the node are accessed, the node's color is ignored.
</p>
\[\begin{align*}
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow Boolean\\
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }nil,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
                    &\text{ }false;\\
    contains\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &node\rightarrow (color,value,nextL,nextR)\\
               &comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,value\rightarrow comparison\\
               &if\text{ }comparison = 0\\
               &\text{ }true\\
               &elif\text{ }comparison = -1\\
               &\text{ }contains\text{ }::\text{ }nextL,a,comp\\
               &else\\
               &\text{ }contains\text{ }::\text{ }nextR,a,comp
\end{align*}\]
<p>
    The color is also ignored for the first part of the (\add\) function. That means that up until the node 
    is added to the tree, the \(add\) function for red black trees has the same behavior and rules as the BST. 
</p>


<h4>A Balancing Act</h4>
<p>
    Just because the node is added to the tree doesn't mean we're done. The tree may be out of balance. Red black 
    trees have two additional rules that are applied after the addition. The first says, "No red child node can 
    have a red parent node." The second says, "Every path from the root to an empty node must have the same 
    number of black nodes." If either of these rules is violated, a re-balance is needed.
</p>
\[\begin{align*}
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }node,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow root\_node\\
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }nil,a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &\text{ }(a,nil,nil);\\
    add\text{ }&::\text{ }node, a,(comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,b\rightarrow n)\rightarrow\\
               &node\rightarrow (value,nextL,nextR)\\
               &if\text{ }comp\text{ }::\text{ }a,value = -1\\
               &\text{ }(value,(add\text{ }::\text{ }nextL,a, comp),nextR\\
               &else\\
               &\text{ }(value,nextL,(add\text{ }::\text{ }nextR,a,comp)).
\end{align*}\]
