<h1>Functional Pattern Discovery</h1>
<div>
    <p>
        The GoF book lists many patterns that are considered to be good in OO Design. As you read, each of these patterns is a proposal as to how a computing problem, not an OO problem, can be efficiently solved using OO design principles. Below is a list of all the patterns listed in the GoF book. Your task this week is to select four of their patterns that were not in the reading and were not discussed in class. For each pattern you select, figure out what the computing problem is that it is used to solve. Then write a short description of the problem. Then, either describe how that pattern is already built into the language you have been using for the class, or proposed a pattern that solves that same problem using functional design.
    </p>
    <p>
        The process of figuring out the computing problem may take a significant amount of pondering and discussion in your group. You may also need to do a lot of Internet searches to figure the problem out as well.
