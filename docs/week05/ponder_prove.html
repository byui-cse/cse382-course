<h2>Task 1</h2>
<p>
   Following the pseudocode functional design in the reading, write a version of the \(chain\) function. Use your <kbd>chain</kbd> implementation to chain a function called multiple times. Compare the speed of your <kbd>chain</kbd> function with using the fold pattern to do chaining of the same set of links. When doing speed tests, the work done by the function should be minimal so you don't mask the differences in speed by what your function is doing.
</p>

<h2>Task 2</h2>
<p>
    Given a list of tuples where each tuple,\(\{month,year,sales\_region,gross\_sales\}\), describes sales for a company in a given region, month, and year, write code to generate a significant list of simulated sales-tracking-tuples. Use either your \(chain\) function implementation or the <kbd>fold</kbd> BIF from your language to find the region with the highest total sales by year from the data in your simulated list.
</p>
<h2>Task 3</h2>
<p>
    Find a sophisticated example of code in your language that is part of an opensource library. Examine it with regard to the definition of beautiful code in the reading. In what ways is the code beautiful and in what ways is it not? Describe in writing how would you change the code to enhance its beauty.
</p>
<h2>Task 4</h2>
<p>
    Find some code you've written in the past that could be improved by applying chaining. Consider why it would be an improvement. Write rules you come up with regarding when chaining is appropriate and when it is not.
</p>

        AFTER you have completed your tasks and debugged your code, <a href="provided_solutions.zip" class="steps_image" alt="one of many possible code solutions">take a look at one of many possible solutions</a> and compare it to the code you wrote.
