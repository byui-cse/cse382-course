<h2>The Anti-Pattern of Ugliness</h2>
<p>
  Why is some code ugly? There are a lot reasons...to many to describe. It's easier to describe what 
  is meant by beautiful code.
</p>
<p>
  <aside class="left_wide">
    
  <figcaption>Fig. 1 - Principles of Beautiful Code</figcaption>
  <figure>Beautiful code is;
    <ul>
      <li>Distilled. There is nothing extraneous or verbose.</li>
      <li>Balanced. Calculations are distributed between deeply thought out and clearly articulated calculation 
      units.</li>
      <li>Harmonious. The calculation units unite in the reader's mind without cognitive conflict to describe how to accomplish the overall task.</li>
      <li>Audacious and Original. Beautiful code surprises the reader by showing new ways to think about a problem.</li>
      <li>Full of Imagery. Words and names are selected to clearly, and with impact, inform the reader what they 
      represent.</li>
      <li>Structured. The location of the code and its design is as important as what the code says.</li>
      <li>Compassionate. Reading the code is a fun and easy undertaking.</li>
    </ul>
  </figure>
  </aside>
</p>
<p>
   Given this definition, beautiful code is easier to read and comprehend, therefore it is easier to debug. 
   For this same reason, it is also easier to extend. Anything that doesn't match this definition might not 
   be outright ugly, but should be improved if for no other reason that to make supporting the code easier.
</p>
  <p>
    Now consider a situation similar to, but not the same as, the map-filter-reduce situation described in the 
    <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121e-course/week03/index.html" target="_blank">CSE 121E</a> or <a href="https://byui-cse.github.io/cse121a-course/week04/" target="_blank">CSE 121A</a> course reading</a>. Now think about a new situation. You have been asked to map, then filter, and then reduce some list. 
    Maybe you've been asked to work with a list of numbers, double them all, keep only those that are greater 
    than 50, and then add up all that remain. If you use the map, filter, and reduce BIF's in a raw way, the 
    naive version of the code to do what you were asked to write looks like this.
  </p>
  <p>
    \[ 
    reduce\::(filter\::(map\::[a]\text{ }f_1\rightarrow [b])
    \text{ }f_2\rightarrow [c])\text{ }f_3\text{ }\rightarrow d\]
  </p>
  <p>
    This code is not harmonious. To understand it, you eventually have to realize that you need to read it 
    from the inside to the outside using order of operations as a guide. That time before you have that 
    realization is cognitive conflict and is, therefore, not harmonious. For this 
    same inside-to-outside reason is also why it is not structured well, violating another principle of 
    beautiful code.
  </p>
  <p>
    While those two reasons are enough to make this code ugly, the problems don't end there. The code is also 
    verbose. Being verbose, it is not distilled. Look at all of those duplicated list notations. Each is just 
    a variation of the last. Why, then, do they have to be there? There is also the name of each function that 
    needs to be used. Again, why? 
  </p>
  <p>
    Is the code compassionate? Not even close. Is it audacious? Nope. It's very pedestrian. If you think about this 
    code snippet some more, you'll find it violates most, if not all, of the principles of beautiful code.
  </p>
  <p>
    The type of code writing exhibited by the above code is evidence that the programmer doesn't understand the 
    possibilities offered by functional programming languages and those that are functional-like. Is there, then, another way?
  </p>
  <h2>Achieving Beauty</h2>
  
  <h4>Chaining</h4>
  <p>
    When considering how to reduce some of the ugliness found in code around the world, it is vital, with any language type, to know and understand all the options that the type of language offers. It is true that functional programming languages, higher-order functions can have a parameter that is a lambda. It is also true that higher-order functions can have a lambda as their value. This may seem strange. Why would such a thing as having a lambda as the value of a function be useful?
  </p>
  <p>
    Take a look at the ugly <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>
    , <kbd>reduce</kbd> code snippet above. It would be much improved if the order of the calls to <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd> were listed from left to right instead of inside to outside. You can do this if you put the calls to the functions into a chain, a series of calls functions to be done.
  </p>
  <aside class="right">
  <figure>
    <dfn>Chaining</dfn> - the process of executing a series of functions where the output of one is used as the input for the next.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 2</figcaption>
  </aside>
  <p>
    If we take another look at how the <kbd>map-filter-reduce</kbd> example above could be written using chaining, beauty emerges. To make this happen, we need to create a list that we choose to call <kbd>links</kbd> where each lambda to be applied to is a link and each link is in the desired order of execution. But before we take express <kbd>chain</kbd> using pseudocode let's express it in mathematical notation. Doing so, it would look like this \([f_1,f_2,f_3]\).
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider a situation where you have a series of numbers and need to double them, keep only those results which are greater than 200, and then sum them. You can put together a list of functions or lambdas that apply a mapping that does the doubling, a filtering that keeps only those greater than 200, and then a reduction that sums those that are left. Then what is needed is a function to execute each of those functions. Let's call that function <kbd>chain</kbd> and pass it the links and the data to act on. The code below shows <kbd>chain</kbd> as a facade function with <kbd>chain_worker</kbd> being the function that does the actual computation.
  </p>
  \[
    \begin{align*}
    -spec\ chain\text{ }&::\ links\text{ }a\rightarrow b\\
    \\
    chain\text{ }&::\ links\text{ }a\rightarrow \\
    &chain\_worker\ (rev\ links)\ a.\\
    \\
    -spec\ chain\_worker\text{ }&::\ reversed\_links\text{ }a\rightarrow b\\
    \\
    chain\_worker\text{ }&::\ []\ a\rightarrow\ a;\\
    chain\_worker\text{ }&::\ [h\mid t]\text{ }a\rightarrow\\
    &h\ (chain\_worker\ t\text{ }a).
    \end{align*}
    \]
  <p>
  Notice that <kbd>chain</kbd> reverses the list of links. This ensures that the functions are executed in the intended order as <kbd>chain_worker</kbd> gets called recursively. Also not that \(a\) and \(b\) in the pseudocode can be of the same type or their types can differ. Additionally, \(a\) can be any type. It is not limited to being a list.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the use of this pattern does lend to the code being more beautiful than the original inside-to-outside <kbd>map-filter-reduce</kbd> example, it is still not as beautiful as it could be. It still uses more lines of code than necessary, is not very audacious, and requires the list to be reversed. Therefore, it could be viewed as an anti-pattern in functional programming. There is a much better option, your language's <kbd>foldl</kbd> BIF if it has one. Using this BIF, all of the code for the <kbd>chain</kbd> function goes away. It isn't needed. The single line of code below replaces it.
  </p>
  \[
    \begin{align*}
    foldl\text{ }&\ (\lambda\ link\_to\_apply\text{ }value \rightarrow (link\_to\_apply\ value))\text{ }values\text{ }links
    \end{align*}
  \]

  <p>
    If your language doesn't have <kbd>foldl</kbd>, you can still reverse the <kbd>links</kbd> list and apply the <kbd>foldr</kbd> BIF.
  </p>
  <p>
    Chaining can be a very useful pattern when a series of functions or lambdas can be considered as a single computational unit. Sometimes the opposite of combining is needed. Then you use currying.
  </p>

    <h3>Currying</h3>
  <p>
    Currying, in Computer Science and Mathematics, is named after the mathematician Haskell 
    Curry and he based this part of his work on what was previously accomplished by Moses Sch&ouml;nfinkel and 
    Gottlob Frege.
  </p>
  <aside class="left">
  <figure>
    <dfn>Currying</dfn> - the process of breaking up a function that has \(n\) parameters into \(n\) 
    functions that have 1 parameter.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 3</figcaption>
  </aside>
  <p>
    The basic idea behind currying is to map a function that has multiple parameters to a series of functions 
    that each have only one. Then, by executing each of the functions, the same result can be achieved. For 
    example, you could think of this as \(f(a,b)\) being the same as \(f(a)(b)\) if \(f(a)\) returned a 
    function that was then passed the parameter \(b\). 
    What you are really doing here, is storing parameters that you do have while you wait for those you don't have yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    It may seem strange that a function could or should return a function, but that's one of the principles 
    that allows functional programming languages to deeply leverage lambdas. Functions, in a functional 
    programming language, are first-class citizens. Or said differently, you can treat a function like 
    anything other type in the language. It can be stored in a variable. It be passed as a parameter. It can 
    be returned from another function. When a function returns a function, this is an example of the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/design_pattern/factory_pattern.htm">Factory Pattern</a>.
  </p>
    <p>
      On of the very beautiful things about the currying in general, is how it can more closely map a function requiring multiple parameters to a real world situation. Consider how people interact with an ATM (cash machine). First they enter a card, then a pin, and finally they indicate what transaction type they want. These three pieces of data could be acted on  by a single function after the data has been collected. This is traditionally what you would see in code and the function could be something like \(perform\_transaction\ card\_number\text{ }pin\text{ }transaction\_id\rightarrow boolean\).
    </p>
    <p>
      If, however, this behavior was curried, the code would be called like this.</kbd>
    </p>
    \[curried\_perform\ card\_number\ pin\ transaction\_id\rightarrow success\]
    <p>
      Notice that each function except for the last returns a lambda that is passed an additional, single piece of data. The currying process is accumulating the parameters of the function. When all of the parameters have been passed, the execution of the code can proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are creating a new function and know that there will be times when only some of the parameters are known and others will be known later, you can create your function curried. You can also do this when there are more than a few parameters and currying will make the use of your function more beautiful. You are not limited to currying when creating functions. You can curry an existing function from any library, custom or language standard, using a function that generates the intermediate lambda functions for you. The pseudocode for such a function is below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pseudocode you will find a mystery function called \(count\) with one parameter, a function. This represents the tools your language makes available to you so you can find out the arity of a function. Another mystery function is \(list\_t0\_params\). This represents the tools you language makes available, if any, to convert a list to a bunch of parameters.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\begin{align*}
      -spec\ curry\ ::&\ f\rightarrow\lambda\\
      \\
      curry\ ::&\ f\rightarrow\\
      &curry\_helper\ f (count\ f)\ [].\\
      \\
      \\
      -spec\ curry\_helper\ ::&\ f\ a:::Integer\ accum:::[b]\rightarrow\lambda\\
      \\
      curry\_helper\ ::&\ f\ 0\ accum\rightarrow\\
      &f\ (reverse(list\_to\_params\ accum));\\
      curry\_helper\ ::&\ f\ count\ accum\rightarrow\\
      &\lambda\ ::\ parameter\rightarrow\\
      &\quad\quad curry\_helper\ f\ count-1\ [parameter]\doubleplus accum.
      \end{align*}\)
    </p>
    <p>
      Now be careful and be wise. Remember that your code must be beautiful. If you start using currying 
      when other choices would be better, your code will quickly digress into ugliness. Use currying to add 
      beauty.
    </p>
    <h3>Partial Completion</h3>
    <p>
      There are times when we need to front-load some computation so that the data that is the result of that computation can be used repeatedly. One way to do this is to apply the principle of partial completion.
    </p>
  <aside class="left">
  <figure>
    <dfn>Partial Completion</dfn> - the principle of breaking up a function that has \(n\) parameters into \(m\) 
    functions that have fewer parameters, occasionally this is \(n\) functions with \(1\) parameter.
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Fig. 4</figcaption>
  </aside>
    <p>
      When you have a major process that your code needs to complete, it is common to need to reuse the results of a portion of the process repeatedly. For example, your code may need to load a large data set and do one or more mappings. Then later, dependent on other calculations or input, do some filtering and sorting.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example, if the data set represented user information for a large social networking company, after doing a bunch of data mapping, there often is a need to accumulate the data in multiple ways. This means you would need to apply different filtering and reducing lambdas for each different accumulation. It would be a waste to reload and re-map the data. It would be much better to reuse the mapped data.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are multiple ways to deal with this situation. One would be to store the mapped data in a database of some sort. That would then require the data to be reloaded. That's going to be slow. The same would happen if you were writing and reading to disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another option could be to store the data in a variable and then create a series of functions, each of which executed a different set of filters and reductions, and has the variable passed to them as a parameter. That's a lot of code to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a more beautiful way. You can create one function that does the mappings and has as its value a lambda, \(a\), which waits for another lambda to use in a filter. When \(a\) is passed some lambda it performs the filter operation and has as its value another lambda waiting for yet another lambda, maybe some more filter, mapping, or reduction lambdas.  
    </p>

    <p>
      Please don't misunderstand me. Partial completion is not limited to situations that use map, filter, or reduce. You are limited only by your imagination on how you can apply this pattern when you are designing your code. It is situationally dependent. What you choose to include at each step of the way is up to you. Just make sure you are increasing the beauty of your code, not making it uglier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this situation. There is a csv file containing data in a table. You need to get statistical information from various columns of this table. There are times when you need data from one column, and times when you need data from other columns. All of this within a single execution of your application.
    </p>
    <p>
      You could write a function that has as parameters the file to load, which column you want the data from, and a lambda that performs all of the calculations to generate the statistical information needed from that column. Unfortunately, this approach will mean reloading and re-preparing the data each time you access a column.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an alternative, you could load and prepare the data and then assign this to a variable. That means you need to pass the variable around to all of the places it is needed, and write a bunch of code, in each place, to indicate the column containing the data and code to calculate the statistics needed. To make this somewhat nicer, you could write a function for each of the columns and statistics needed from that column. Unfortunately, you will either write just a few functions to cover just a few situations or you will need to write a function for all possible combinations of columns and statistics needed. Ouch! That's a lot of functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you were to use partial completion, you could write a function, let's call this one <kbd>load_and_prep</kbd>, that loads and prepares the data and has as its value a lambda waiting for which column to work with. Let's call that the <kbd>column lambda</kbd>. The <kbd>column lambda</kbd> could have as its value a lambda, we'll call this one the <kbd>stats lambda</kbd>, that performs the statistical calculations you want done. Now you've covered all possible combinations, even those you haven't thought of yet. Using this setup would look like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(data\leftarrow load\_and\_prep\ \ 'nation\_wide\_purchases.csv'\)
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, when conditional choices had been made due to further data gathering and calculation, you could decide which column or columns you need to manipulate. Such a use could look like this.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(columns\leftarrow data\ [zip,region,state,amount]\)
    </p>
    <p>
      Even later, you could apply some lambda to get the statistics you want. You could even apply different lambdas depending on the specific situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(stats\_by\_zip\leftarrow\ columns\ \lambda\)
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also possible, if you know all of these elements at the same time to apply them to the loaded and prepared data. For example,
    </p>
    <p>
      \(stats\_by\_zip\leftarrow data\ \ 'nation\_wide\_purchases.csv'\ [zip,region,state,amount]\ \lambda\).
    </p>
    <p>
      Partial completion gives you the most flexibility with the least complicatedness in these types of situations. Remember, use it when it will increase the beauty of your code.
    </p>
