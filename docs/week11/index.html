<h2>Tries</h2>
<p>
  Consider a situation where a binary search tree has been created using complicated data that requires a complicated comparison when traversing the tree. If the tree is of any significant size, the comparisons can become a drag on the speed of execution. Maybe the complicated data in the tree looks something like this tuple\(\{last\_name,first\_name,address\}\). It is then necessary to reduce the amount of comparison computations to increase the speed of traversal.
</p>
<p>
   When an insert or search is done in this binary search tree, if the first comparison the code is doing compares last names, there is a lot of duplication of computation due to people with the same last name but differing first names or addresses. If the address is the first thing compared, there are a lot of common portions of street addresses and therefore, again, a lot of duplicated computation.
</p>

    <dfn>Trie</dfn> - for \(k\ge 2\), a \(k\)-ary search tree with augmented edges rather than augmented nodes where the augmentation data indicates the subnode to search and, eventually, the result of the search or insertion.

<p>
  The purpose of Tries is to reduce duplication of comparisons for complicated data with a lot of possible partially duplicate data points. Also, each trie is a tree with some number of sub-nodes. In binary trees, the the upper limit is 2 sub-nodes. There is no limit to the number of sub-nodes in a trie. However, as the engineer, you must select some rational way, given your data to represent the possible sub-nodes. If a representation was selected that was in conflict with your data, the trie could degrade into a list or a binary tree. Be wise and select the appropriate data structure to hold the outgoing nodes based on known and anticipated data.
