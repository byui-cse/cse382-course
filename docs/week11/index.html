<h2>Tries</h2>
<p>
  Consider a situation where a binary search tree has been created using complicated data that requires a complicated comparison when traversing the tree. If the tree is of any significant size, the comparisons can become a drag on the speed of execution. Maybe the complicated data in the tree looks something like this tuple\(\{last\_name,first\_name,address\}\). It is then necessary to reduce the amount of comparison computations to increase the speed of traversal.
</p>
<p>
   When an insert or search is done in this binary search tree, if the first comparison the code is doing compares last names, there is a lot of duplication of computation due to people with the same last name but differing first names or addresses. If the address is the first thing compared, there are a lot of common portions of street addresses and therefore, again, a lot of duplicated computation.
</p>

</aside>
<p>
  The purpose of Tries is to reduce duplication of comparisons for complicated data with a lot of possible partially duplicate data points. Also, each trie is a tree with some number of sub-tries. In binary trees, the the upper limit is 2 sub-trees. There is no limit to the number of sub-tries in a trie. However, as the engineer, you must select some rational way, given the data to be stored in the trie, to contain the possible sub-tries. If a representation was selected that was in conflict with your data, the trie could degrade into a list or a binary tree. Be wise and select the appropriate data structure to indicate edges for sub-tries based on known and anticipated data. The pseudocode below describes the node structure that is used through the remainder of this reading. Notice I, the author, have selected a dictionary that maps each edge indicator to the root node of a sub-trie. This choice is arbitrary given that the data to be used with the trie pseudocode below is unknown.
</p>

    \[
    \begin{align*}
    [a\looparrowleft b:::trie]:::trie
    \end{align*}
    \]

<p>
  The type of \(a\) can be any single, not composite, type. Alphanumeric characters are the most common type for \(a\).
</p>
<h2>A Common Example</h2>
<p>
  Consider this situation. You need to be able to search a large data set consisting of last names, first names, ages, addresses, and other pieces of data regarding people. You could hash the data of each individual and use a dictionary. If there are \(n\) characters being hashed, hashing the data for each search would be a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) process followed by a \(\mathcal{O}\) search process for an overall complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(n)\).  
</p>
<p>
  Using a trie would also be \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) yet there would be no collisions and rehashing during the trie creation process like there would be in the dictionary creation process. This may make the use of the trie more efficient, depending on the structure of  the data.
</p>
<aside class="right">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/bad_trie.png" alt="a branching tree diagram showing the names Daniel, and Dani being fully overlapped by Daniella.">
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Figure. 2</figcaption>
</aside>
<p>
  Also, this data regarding people will be of different lengths. When each piece of data is appended to produce a single alpha-numeric string, people's names, addresses, etc yields strings of varying lengths. Therefore, the \(a\) type will also need to include a data end indicator. The simplified diagram below consists just of first names to help clarify the need for an end-of-data-indicator.
</p>

<p>
  Consider this set of names. Daniel, Daniella, Dani, Della, Denver, and Dylan. Without data-end indicators, Figure 2 would describe the trie. In this visualization, and without an end-of-data-indicator, it is impossible to tell if Dani or Daniel are found in the trie, or if only Danielle was added. This is why the end-of-data-indicator is so important.
</p>
<p>
  Consider if \(end\) was used as the end-of-data-indicator. then the data in a new trie could be visualized as in Figure 3.  
</p>
<aside class="left">
  <figure>
    <img src="images/good_trie.png" alt="a branching tree diagram showing the names Daniel, and Dani being fully overlapped by Daniella.">
  </figure>
    <figcaption>Figure. 3</figcaption>
</aside>
<p>
  Now, if Dani was searched for, when the character \(i\) is reached, it is known that Dani was added as data. This may have happened before Danielle or Daniel were added or after. That isn't relevant. All that is needed is when all the characters in a search string have been found, there is an end-of-data-indicator that is one of the sub-tries of the current node.
</p>
<p>
  Tries can be very useful when doing checks for existence for many types of data, not just data about people. You are limited only by your imagination. But consider this situation. What if all of the data didn't start with the same alpha-numeric character? How then can there be a root of the trie? There are many ways this could be resolved, but one of the most significant is the use of forests. 
</p>
<p>
  A forest of tries would consist of a collection with the data type being tries. As an analogy, a pine forest can be viewed as consisting of a collection of pine trees. The collection that is used to hold each of the tries could be a tuple, a list, a dictionary, a binary tree, or any other data structure type that makes sense for the number of tries in the forest.
</p>
<p>
  If I, the author, was working with data where I knew the first alpha-numeric characters were fairly evenly distributed, meaning each has a nearly equal possibility of being a root of a trie, I would use a special trie_node with \(root\) as its value and the node's data structure element to hold my trie forest. If, on the other hand, I knew there were only three or four possible first characters, I would consider using a tuple. Which collection you use for your trie forest should be determined by the data you are including in the forest.
</p>
<p>
  You might choose to use a trie forest when implementing a spell-checker or a word completion suggestion tool. Given any initial, ordered list of characters, all words beginning with that initial list could be displayed. Also, as the user entered additional characters the list of potential completions could be filtered, giving the user just the appropriate, complete words. This could be done for any text editor, including those used to write code.
</p>
<h2>Trie Algorithms</h2>
<p>
  In addition to the node above, there are two algorithms that make up the trie behavior. Here they are called \(lookup\) and \(add\). Since both of these require the use of recursion to search for either an existing piece of data or a location for another piece of data, it is no surprise that the pseudocode for them is quite similar. 
</p>
<p>
  In the \(lookup\) algorithm, the head of the data list is popped during each recursion. If it is found to be a key of the current trie, then the recursion continues, if not, the recursion ends with a find failure. If, on the other hand, the list is emptied and the current trie has the \(end\) indicator as a key, the recursion ends with a find success. The pseudocode below describes this behavior.
</p>
 \[
    \begin{align*}
lookup\ ::&\ [a]\ trie:::[a\looparrowleft b]\rightarrow \{ok\_fail,trie\}\\
\\
lookup\ ::&\ []\ trie\ when\ end\in\ trie\_keys\rightarrow\\
  &\{ok,found\};\\
lookup\ ::&\ []\ trie\ otherwise\rightarrow\\
  &\{fail,none\};\\
lookup\ ::&\ [h\mid t]\ trie\ when\ h\not\in\ trie\_keys\rightarrow\\
  &\{fail,none\};\\
lookup\ ::&\ [h\mid t]\ trie\ otherwise\rightarrow\\
  &sub\_trie=h\twoheadrightarrow trie\\
  &lookup\ t\ sub\_trie.
\end{align*}

 \]
<p>
  As mentioned previously, both the \(lookup\) algorithm description above and the \(add\) algorithm description below use recursion to evaluate a trie. Therefore it is no surprise that the pseudocode is similar for both algorithms. A helper algorithm called \(build\_branch\) is used by \(add\) to increase readability. The \(build\_branch\) algorithm is used to add a series of trie nodes as a branch when needed. For example, if a trie contained this series of nodes, \(D\rightarrow a\rightarrow n\rightarrow i\rightarrow end\) and the name Daniella needed to be added, a branch for the e,l,l, and a characters is needed. The \(build\_branch\) algorithm handles this. It adds any data still in the list when leaving a common portion of the trie. Figure 4 shows the end result of applying \(build\_branch\) when adding Daniella to a trie containing Dani.
</p>

    <figcaption>Figure. 4</figcaption>
</aside>


 \[
\begin{align*}
add\ ::&\ [a]\ trie:::[a\looparrowleft trie]\rightarrow trie\\
\\
add\ ::&\ []\ trie\rightarrow\\
  &[end\looparrowleft none];\\
add\ ::&\ [h\mid t]\ trie\ when\ h\in\ trie\_keys\rightarrow\\
  &sub\_trie = h\twoheadrightarrow trie\\
  &trie\twoheadleftarrow\ h\looparrowleft (add\ t\ sub\_trie);\\
add\ ::&\ [h\mid t]\ trie\ otherwise\rightarrow\\
  &trie\twoheadleftarrow\ h\ (build\_branch\ t).
\end{align*}
 \]

 \[
    \begin{align*}
build\_branch\ ::&\ []\rightarrow\\
  &[end\looparrowleft\ none];\\
build\_branch\ ::&\ [h\mid t]\rightarrow\\
  &[h\looparrowleft build\_branch\ t].
\end{align*}
 \]
<p>
  In the pseudocode above, there are many interactions with dictionaries. How this is done in code is language dependent. However, \[add\  ``Dani"\ [\ \looparrowleft\ ]\] would initialize a trie with the string \(Dani\).
</p>
<h2>Similar Data Structures</h2>
<p>
  There are other options that are similar, but not the same as tries. <a href="http://classes.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com/~barr/classes/comp410/papers/2002-burst_tries_a_fast_efficient_data_structure_for_string_keys">Burst tries</a> are one of these. It may be that using a burst trie could be more efficient than using a trie but only if there is some sub-set of data that is more frequently accessed than the rest of the data. Burst tries are a type of adaptive data structure. This means the location in the structure changes to move the most sought after data to locations where fewer comparisons are needed to determine if the data is in the collection.
</p>
<p>
   If there is a more commonly used sub-set of data and this sub-set remains fairly constant over time, the cost of rebuilding the data structure can be amortized to reduce overall cost. If the sub-set doesn't exist or is not consistent over time, a burst trie would not be a good choice. Again, this is an example of you, as the engineer, needing to be aware of your data and its use.
