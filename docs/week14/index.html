    <p>Reflection</p>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
  You have experience with multiple languages, some functional some not. You've also used Python to write code in a functional-style. Consider all the patterns you've learned in this class and those you've used and discovered previously.
</p>
<p>
  Why is it that when you compare non-functional design and programming to functional programming design and programming some coding challenges are easier to accomplish using functional design and others are not? For those that are easier done using functional design and programming, what is it about them that lend themselves to be solved using FD? 
</p>
<p>
  Write a reflective document encapsulating your experience and thoughts regarding these questions. Writing a logical, well thought out, well structured, and well written document about this prepares you for future engineering meetings when decisions are being made as to what types of languages will be used in the project under consideration.
</p>
<p>
  Spend some time with this. Don't short yourself. The better you prepare now, the better prepared you will be then...and you will be in many such meetings.
